Hey this is the question for exercise 72 and this is quite an interesting program that you'll make here

1
00:08.550 --> 00:17.350
if you can, so please create a script that lets users, so it from the user to enter a search term.

2
00:17.490 --> 00:24.930
Browser opens and the browser searches on Google for that term.

3
00:25.530 --> 00:27.470
So all this happens automatically.

4
00:27.480 --> 00:28.770
Let me demonstrate the script.

5
00:31.510 --> 00:34.760
Python.

6
00:34.840 --> 00:40.120
So the script is asking me for a query let's say tomato types.

7
00:40.960 --> 00:43.030
I press Enter now as a user.

8
00:43.090 --> 00:49.910
The browser opens and searches on Google for tomato types as you see the query here.

9
00:51.600 --> 00:54.810
So it requires some research and I wish you good luck with this.

10
00:54.810 --> 00:55.110
Thanks.
