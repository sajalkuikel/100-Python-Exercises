Hi and this is the solution to exercise 60 and you are asked to create a program that prints hello

1
00:09.450 --> 00:17.380
repeatedly. Let me execute the script 60.

2
00:17.410 --> 00:18.530
Hello hello hello.

3
00:18.610 --> 00:23.310
This is being printed out every fraction of a second.

4
00:23.470 --> 00:25.180
Actually the speed

5
00:25.260 --> 00:28.610
if you're asking how often hello with the printed out,

6
00:28.720 --> 00:32.400
well that depends on the speed of your processor.

7
00:32.880 --> 00:41.830
And so this is the simple solution. We are using a while loop. While loop is another type of loop.

8
00:41.890 --> 00:47.890
So we have for loops and we have while loops and this is a bit of an abstract concept.

9
00:47.880 --> 00:54.510
So it was while true print hello and true is always true.

10
00:54.850 --> 01:01.300
Therefore hello will be printed all the time and of course you can replace these to

11
01:01.300 --> 01:13.580
I don't know, if while 1 is less than 2, print hello CTRL C to interrupt the script.

12
01:13.670 --> 01:19.500
These again will be doing the same thing because one is less than two.

13
01:19.690 --> 01:27.770
So your processor checks these every fraction of a second of a second and it does this action.

14
01:27.970 --> 01:34.690
Actually Python checks it while your processor decides how often it can check it. This is about the

15
01:34.910 --> 01:37.980
while loop and about exercise 60.

16
01:38.230 --> 01:39.130
I'll talk to you later.

17
01:39.130 --> 01:39.760
Thanks a lot!
