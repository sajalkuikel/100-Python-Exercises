Hello! This is the question for exercise 65 and this code is exactly the same code that I handed to you

1
00:10.050 --> 00:13.400
for exercise 64.

2
00:14.820 --> 00:18.980
So what this does is it prints hello.

3
00:19.500 --> 00:27.360
However for this exercise I'd like to ask you to change this statement to something else.

4
00:27.450 --> 00:32.280
So that hello is printed out repeatedly and hi

5
00:32.400 --> 00:33.820
never printed.

6
00:34.120 --> 00:37.160
So the code wold do like hello hello hello hello

7
00:37.170 --> 00:42.740
all the time and I want you to do that by just changing this break statement to something else.

8
00:43.900 --> 00:44.740
Well, good luck!

9
00:44.740 --> 00:45.430
I'll talk to you later.
