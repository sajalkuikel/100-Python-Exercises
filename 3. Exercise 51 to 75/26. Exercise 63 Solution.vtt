Hello, this is a solution to exercise 63.

1
00:04.540 --> 00:12.240
And for this exercise you were asked to write a program that behaves like this, so it prints of hello

2
00:12.240 --> 00:17.010
instantly and then it prints it out after second, and then after two seconds, and then after three

3
00:17.010 --> 00:24.980
seconds here, and then the program prints out end of loop and it terminates.

4
00:25.060 --> 00:27.220
And yeah, this is the solution.

5
00:27.240 --> 00:33.540
We're using the time module again. We are using a counter starting from i

6
00:33.880 --> 00:35.200
equals to 0.

7
00:35.700 --> 00:38.370
So again the question asks to print hello

8
00:38.370 --> 00:42.130
instantly first so this is what we're doing here.

9
00:42.190 --> 00:51.540
And you increase the counter so you are ready for the next iteration where you wait for seconds but

10
00:52.500 --> 00:56.320
you also need to check if you're waiting more than three seconds.

11
00:56.340 --> 01:00.390
Because if that is true we want to break the loop.

12
01:00.390 --> 01:06.440
We want to print out end of loop and we want to break the loop so this break statement here will break the loop

13
01:06.440 --> 01:08.360
so it will interrupt the loop.

14
01:08.700 --> 01:12.650
Therefore we don't have more code after the while loop.

15
01:12.840 --> 01:20.540
So the script, the program will stop, but in the first iteration i is just the one.

16
01:20.760 --> 01:23.040
So it's not greater then three.

17
01:23.140 --> 01:30.140
Therefore the script will sleep for one second in here and we'll go again in here.

18
01:30.330 --> 01:31.620
Hello.

19
01:32.010 --> 01:38.130
And then i will increase by 1, so it will be 2, but it's not equal to, it's not a greater than three again.

20
01:38.130 --> 01:45.660
So these lines are not executed, and then the script will sleep for three seconds, and then it goes to three. Three is

21
01:45.690 --> 01:47.430
not greater than three.

22
01:47.580 --> 01:50.230
Therefore we execute this again three seconds.

23
01:50.280 --> 01:58.860
But then when he goes the 4. 4 is greater than 3 therefore we get print end of loop and break the

24
01:58.860 --> 01:59.960
script.

25
01:59.970 --> 02:05.770
I hope this is clear enough to understand, but ask questions if you like.

26
02:05.820 --> 02:06.320
Thanks.

27
02:06.340 --> 02:06.870
And see you later.
