All right, here is the solution to exercise 64 where you are asked to replace the break statement with

1
00:08.430 --> 00:11.960
another thing so that you get.

2
00:11.960 --> 00:12.290
Hello.

3
00:12.290 --> 00:12.550
Hi.

4
00:12.560 --> 00:12.800
Hello.

5
00:12.800 --> 00:13.010
Hi.

6
00:13.010 --> 00:13.280
Hello.

7
00:13.280 --> 00:24.970
Printed out repeatedly. And so I replaced this with pass however, so let me try this.

8
00:25.990 --> 00:26.270
Hello.

9
00:26.270 --> 00:26.500
Hi.

10
00:26.510 --> 00:26.750
Hello.

11
00:26.750 --> 00:26.990
Hi.

12
00:26.990 --> 00:27.200
Hello.

13
00:27.200 --> 00:27.410
Hi.

14
00:27.410 --> 00:34.960
And so on. However you can another expression here which is not a break expression.

15
00:35.030 --> 00:39.080
So if you did for example one plus one you'd get the same result

16
00:41.830 --> 00:48.180
because what's happening is while true which is always true print hello if two is greater than one.

17
00:48.260 --> 00:51.380
It is greater than one. Just do one plus one.

18
00:51.490 --> 00:57.750
Don't print anything.  Don't assign anything. Just do an operation. And then

19
00:58.080 --> 01:02.770
the operation is done and then Python goes to the next line and it prints,

20
01:03.010 --> 01:04.660
so it doesn't break the loop.

21
01:04.670 --> 01:11.250
However if you pass pass that means just go to the next line.

22
01:11.340 --> 01:14.070
You know nothing to see here go to the next line.

23
01:14.500 --> 01:19.290
So pass is a nice piece of a statement that you can use some time.

24
01:19.390 --> 01:20.650
This is about the solution.

25
01:20.680 --> 01:22.030
And I'll talk to you later.

26
01:22.030 --> 01:22.350
Thanks.
