Hey! Hi again, this is the solution to exercise 65.

1
00:03.690 --> 00:10.060
And the answer is you need to replace the break statement with a continue statement.

2
00:10.110 --> 00:10.770
So if you execute

3
00:10.770 --> 00:12.520
the code now,

4
00:15.930 --> 00:17.480
you get hello hello hello

5
00:17.540 --> 00:20.160
printed out repeatedly.

6
00:21.360 --> 00:23.720
So that was the question for the exercise.

7
00:23.730 --> 00:30.180
You need to print out hello repeatedly and you never print out hi. Why this happens is because you know

8
00:30.580 --> 00:37.250
while true print hello if two is greater than one. It is greater then one, continue. What continue

9
00:37.310 --> 00:42.880
does it continues the loop from the beginning

10
00:43.430 --> 00:51.050
if this condition is true and so this condition is always true so what Python will do, what continue will

11
00:51.050 --> 00:58.550
do, it will is to repeat the loop always repeatedly and it will never go through this line.

12
00:58.580 --> 01:07.660
That's what continue does. So it's like the opposite of break because break breaks the loop at this

13
01:07.660 --> 01:08.920
point.

14
01:08.930 --> 01:16.170
It doesn't go to the next iteration of the loop but instead it goes the next line and pass.

15
01:16.190 --> 01:19.820
What pass does is it prints,

16
01:19.910 --> 01:22.730
it executes the next line.

17
01:22.730 --> 01:30.290
But then the loop goes again repeatedly.  It executes again, and again, and again.

18
01:30.380 --> 01:36.950
So this is the difference between these three statements break, pass, and continue.

19
01:36.950 --> 01:39.390
I hope this was useful and I'll talk to you later.
