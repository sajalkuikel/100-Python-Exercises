Hi again, this is the question to exercise 64. This is an interesting exercise.  This prints out

1
00:09.630 --> 00:10.420
hello.

2
00:10.590 --> 00:15.170
This is what this code prints out and this is the question.

3
00:15.660 --> 00:25.770
So the following code prints hello and checks if two is greater than one and it breaks the loop because

4
00:25.800 --> 00:27.820
two is actually greater than one.

5
00:28.110 --> 00:33.460
So the loop breaks and print hi is not executed.

6
00:33.460 --> 00:39.920
Therefore whenever you execute the script you get hello only.

7
00:41.120 --> 00:50.760
Now the question is I'd like to ask you to replace the break statement with something else so that both

8
00:50.790 --> 00:57.350
hello and hi are printed out repeatedly so you'd get

9
00:57.450 --> 00:57.810
Hello. Hi.

10
00:57.810 --> 00:58.440
Hello.

11
00:58.440 --> 00:58.700
Hi.

12
00:58.710 --> 00:58.980
Hello.

13
00:58.980 --> 00:59.210
Hi.

14
00:59.220 --> 00:59.430
Hello.

15
00:59.430 --> 00:59.750
Hi.

16
00:59.760 --> 01:04.530
And so on. But please don't change any other part of the code.

17
01:04.620 --> 01:08.280
Just this line. Change this to something else.

18
01:08.280 --> 01:10.710
Please find out with what.

19
01:10.710 --> 01:11.660
I'll talk to you later.
