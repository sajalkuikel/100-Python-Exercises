Hi, this is the question for exercise 75 and for this exercise

1
00:05.520 --> 00:11.510
I'd like you to plot the data in the file provided through this URL.

2
00:11.770 --> 00:15.150
So this is the text file we worked earlier.

3
00:16.200 --> 00:16.960
This one here.

4
00:17.000 --> 00:28.630
So we have two columns with values and I wanted to use this input so that you create a script which

5
00:28.720 --> 00:33.970
when executed produces this plot.

6
00:34.870 --> 00:39.830
So these are the values of x and y.

7
00:40.900 --> 00:47.110
So 3, 5, 4, 9, and so on. We have five points and

8
00:48.640 --> 00:53.220
please keep in mind that you don't have to use this particular plot.

9
00:53.410 --> 00:56.350
You can use any plot library that you want.

10
00:56.350 --> 01:01.600
The important thing is you use a library so that you plug this data somehow.

11
01:01.600 --> 01:03.080
Thanks and I'll talk to you later!
