This is a solution to exercise 62 and I asked you to create a program that prints hello repeatedly after a

1
00:09.720 --> 00:17.810
one second first, and after two seconds, three, four, and so increasing the interval by one.

2
00:18.510 --> 00:27.780
So your output would look like... Hello first is later then one second, and then after two seconds,

3
00:27.780 --> 00:38.340
and then one two, three, and then one, two, three, and four, so after four seconds, and so on five, and six and so on.

4
00:38.340 --> 00:39.390
For the solution

5
00:39.390 --> 00:47.250
again we are using the time module and then we need to set up a counter while loop. We start from i equals

6
00:47.400 --> 00:51.010
to zero while true. True is always true.

7
00:51.170 --> 00:55.430
So this loop will be executed infinitely.

8
00:55.980 --> 01:02.160
So in the first iteration what we do is we increase it by 1 immediately.

9
01:02.160 --> 01:07.470
So in the first iteration i will be equal to zero plus one equals to one.

10
01:07.470 --> 01:09.120
So i is one in here.

11
01:09.360 --> 01:13.260
And so in the first iteration we print hello instantly.

12
01:13.440 --> 01:16.710
So we haven't applied a sleep method yet.

13
01:17.250 --> 01:19.220
And so we print hello instantly.

14
01:19.470 --> 01:21.810
That was the first print in here.

15
01:22.490 --> 01:26.240
And then we sleep for one second.

16
01:26.240 --> 01:33.330
And then we go to the next iteration. We increase i by another value, so increase i by 1.

17
01:33.360 --> 01:35.990
So we get i equals to 2.

18
01:36.180 --> 01:38.960
We print hello and then we sleep

19
01:39.030 --> 01:41.660
two seconds and we go again.

20
01:41.700 --> 01:44.730
We do this right away three equals,

21
01:44.910 --> 01:49.340
i equals to three. Print hello and so on and so forth.

22
01:49.350 --> 01:55.280
You could have this expression, maybe in here that would be fine as well.

23
01:55.330 --> 01:58.430
So you get the same output.

24
01:59.250 --> 02:01.730
Hello instantly. Hello after one second.

25
02:01.890 --> 02:07.280
After two seconds, after three seconds and so on, so it's the same thing.

26
02:07.840 --> 02:09.990
I hope this is clear. I'll talk to you later.
