Hello, this is a question for exercise 73.

1
00:04.890 --> 00:10.530
For this exercise please multiply the values of the text file in the URL

2
00:10.860 --> 00:12.300
which I'll show in just a bit.

3
00:12.330 --> 00:14.490
URL of the file.

4
00:14.660 --> 00:19.890
So multiply those values by two and export the output to a new file.

5
00:19.920 --> 00:21.180
Let me show you

6
00:21.300 --> 00:25.160
the URL I'm talking about, so

7
00:25.170 --> 00:27.210
this is the text file.

8
00:27.210 --> 00:33.130
So just get this URL. www.pythonhow.com/data

9
00:33.220 --> 00:34.230
/sampledata

10
00:34.560 --> 00:35.040
.txt.

11
00:38.820 --> 00:40.770
Let's go back here.

12
00:41.280 --> 00:46.390
Like that, and so I want you to multiply those values by two.

13
00:46.550 --> 00:53.940
So you from 3, 5,  you'd get 6, 10 and 8, 18 and so on.

14
00:53.940 --> 00:57.130
So you end up with this text file.

15
00:58.080 --> 01:07.550
So from this one here to this text file,  X-Y 6, 10,  8,18, and so on.

16
01:07.750 --> 01:10.780
This is what you have to do with Python in this exercise.

17
01:10.780 --> 01:11.140
Thanks.
