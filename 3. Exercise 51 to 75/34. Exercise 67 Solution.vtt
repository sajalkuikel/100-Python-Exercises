Hello again! This is the solution to exercise 67.

1
00:06.030 --> 00:09.670
So this exercise asked you to use this dictionary

2
00:09.810 --> 00:16.620
and prompt the user to enter a word and then you'd use this dictionary to translate that word

3
00:17.190 --> 00:19.910
from English to Portuguese.

4
00:19.920 --> 00:26.580
However in this exercise I also asked you to return a message when the word was not in the dictionary

5
00:26.880 --> 00:33.240
and to implement that's you want to use a try and accept statement.

6
00:33.300 --> 00:41.720
So what this does is it tries this statement and if it doesn't get an error it doesn't execute these other

7
00:41.730 --> 00:45.000
statements, but it just goes to the next lines.

8
00:45.300 --> 00:49.600
So it will print out the translation for that word.

9
00:49.620 --> 00:53.470
However if there is an error the script will not break.

10
00:53.610 --> 00:55.100
So Python will try these.

11
00:55.140 --> 01:02.430
And if this happens to have an error, then Python will go to this line and it will return

12
01:02.640 --> 01:05.850
that word does not exist.

13
01:05.900 --> 01:08.080
Now you see this key error here.

14
01:08.130 --> 01:10.950
This is one of the error types in Python.

15
01:11.200 --> 01:14.670
And you can also choose to not include that.

16
01:14.670 --> 01:19.750
So you just say except if there is any type of error occurring in the code.

17
01:19.890 --> 01:25.390
And then Python will go and execute this line, this message.

18
01:25.410 --> 01:28.770
So let me try this.

19
01:28.770 --> 01:35.100
Python 67. Enter word, random word and It says the word does not exist.

20
01:35.280 --> 01:41.170
However it's advisable to actually mention the error name explicitly.

21
01:41.580 --> 01:48.510
This is good to have the key error explicitly there because you have more control on, as programmer you have

22
01:48.510 --> 01:51.330
more control on what's happening with your script.

23
01:51.330 --> 01:53.430
So you know what errors you're getting there.

24
01:53.670 --> 01:58.390
So it's recommended to enter the type of the error here explicitly.

25
01:58.650 --> 01:59.900
I hope this was clear.

26
01:59.970 --> 02:02.770
Ask questions if you like and I'll talk to you later.
