Hi! This video is about the tools you need to complete this course.

1
00:05.820 --> 00:09.670
So let's keep this to the point. The first thing you need is a computer.

2
00:09.690 --> 00:12.590
It could be Linux, Mac, or Windows.

3
00:12.790 --> 00:14.900
Everyone of them would do the job.

4
00:15.210 --> 00:17.870
And the second thing you need is Python.

5
00:17.880 --> 00:20.520
So you need to have Python installed in your computer.

6
00:20.550 --> 00:23.040
It could be Python 2, or Python 3.

7
00:23.280 --> 00:29.790
So both of them would do the job well but I recommend Python 3. Python 3 is what I use

8
00:30.780 --> 00:33.420
and it's the latest version of Python.

9
00:33.810 --> 00:40.670
If you don't have Python at all you can go to this website and you can download Python and then install it.

10
00:40.710 --> 00:42.480
It's quite straightforward.

11
00:42.480 --> 00:47.160
The third thing you need is an editor where you can write an executable code.

12
00:47.580 --> 00:50.330
I'd suggest you use your favorite editor.

13
00:50.340 --> 00:53.170
All editors are around the same.

14
00:53.230 --> 00:54.720
My favorite editor is Atom.

15
00:54.780 --> 01:01.420
So if you don't have a favorite editor, you can go ahead and download Atom from this Website and then

16
01:01.440 --> 01:02.700
then install it.

17
01:02.760 --> 01:06.970
The process is straightforward, and yeah that's the three things you need.

18
01:07.080 --> 01:13.240
Once you have installed Atom to use it what you do is you are in a directory for instance in here and

19
01:13.390 --> 01:17.320
here all these directories they have Python scripts inside.

20
01:17.590 --> 01:28.750
And I can right click in here, go to open with Atom and that will open Atom in the current directory.

21
01:28.890 --> 01:33.090
Then I suggest you use a package.

22
01:33.450 --> 01:38.430
Go to packages, settings view, open and search here.

23
01:38.790 --> 01:46.470
So you go here to install and then search for platformio-ide-terminal. So click enter. That will search

24
01:46.470 --> 01:53.940
for packages with that name and you'll see here you'll have a button installed.

25
01:53.940 --> 01:56.160
I have installed this so I don't have that button.

26
01:56.220 --> 02:02.910
So just go ahead and install the package and then close settings and then you can go ahead to the plus  sign.

27
02:04.590 --> 02:07.830
And that will open a terminal inside Python.

28
02:07.920 --> 02:11.150
Here you can execute Python scripts.

29
02:11.190 --> 02:21.870
So for instance I can go inside this directory here with cd Variables. Tab for auto completion, enter and then

30
02:22.530 --> 02:32.120
Python 303 is the script name, tab, execute and that's how you execute Python scripts.

31
02:32.400 --> 02:35.930
So this is how you use ATOM to write.

32
02:35.940 --> 02:43.000
So you write Python code here and you execute Python code in platformio ide terminal.

33
02:43.100 --> 02:44.800
And that concludes this video.

34
02:44.990 --> 02:46.440
Thanks, I'll talk to you later.
