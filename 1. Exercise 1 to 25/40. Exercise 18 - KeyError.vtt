This is the question of exercise 18. For this exercise

1
00:06.060 --> 00:11.580
what I want to do is I want to print out surname Smith in the terminal.

2
00:11.610 --> 00:19.130
This is the script I have, but if I execute that I get a key error.

3
00:19.320 --> 00:23.360
So the question is please explain why we get a key error here.

4
00:23.490 --> 00:28.030
And how do we access name surname Smith.

5
00:28.320 --> 00:31.830
So to print it out in the terminal. Thanks.
