This is a video where I'll give you the solution to the current exercise. If you followed the previous

1
00:06.410 --> 00:10.780
exercises you have noted that the solutions were given in text format.

2
00:10.790 --> 00:15.770
However for some exercises such as this one where  I think I need to give you a broader explanation on

3
00:15.770 --> 00:20.500
how the exercise is solved, the format will be video.

4
00:20.510 --> 00:27.170
This also helps you relief reading fatigue and eyestrain so you get more engaged with the course and

5
00:27.170 --> 00:29.000
eventually you'll learn better.

6
00:29.360 --> 00:32.090
So I'll be combining video and text throughout the course.

7
00:33.040 --> 00:38.160
Now back to the solution of this exercise. Right click, open Atom.

8
00:38.350 --> 00:44.260
So I'm using Atom editor to write and execute my code.

9
00:47.750 --> 00:53.310
Let me close all the tabs and open Exercise 3.

10
00:53.340 --> 00:54.380
dot py.

11
00:55.350 --> 01:00.770
I'm also using the platformio ide package.

12
01:00.900 --> 01:04.400
So it's an embedded terminal and this is the solution.

13
01:04.420 --> 01:11.670
So for this exercise you are asked to tell about the reason you're getting an error and the error was a

14
01:11.980 --> 01:12.910
name error.

15
01:13.290 --> 01:19.270
You always always need to focus on the error message so don't panic, don't ignore the error.

16
01:19.620 --> 01:21.430
This is very important.

17
01:22.110 --> 01:25.340
So here you have the line where the error is occurring.

18
01:25.360 --> 01:32.380
So this file 3.py line 4. And here is the line printed out.

19
01:32.550 --> 01:33.940
So this is one in here.

20
01:34.170 --> 01:35.930
And then you have the type of the error.

21
01:35.940 --> 01:42.570
So there are many types of errors of errors and name error is one of the types. A name error means

22
01:42.570 --> 01:52.020
that a name you have provided in the code it's not valid but you need to see the explanation beside

23
01:52.170 --> 01:53.690
the type of the error.

24
01:53.760 --> 01:58.600
So after the colon you usually have the explanation of the error.

25
01:58.620 --> 02:02.620
This says name C is not defined, so name C is not defined.

26
02:02.840 --> 02:06.140
And that is true you haven't defined any names in here.

27
02:06.450 --> 02:12.690
So that's the reason of the error. These are assignments operators and so these are comparison operators.

28
02:12.720 --> 02:15.870
So you are comparing if a equals to b,

29
02:16.020 --> 02:22.600
so if value of a is equal to b and if value of b is equal to c, but c doesn't have a value.

30
02:22.630 --> 02:24.070
And so you're geting an error.

31
02:24.330 --> 02:29.220
So if your logic was the same as mine then you can mark this exercise as solved.

32
02:29.460 --> 02:30.700
Great, then I'll talk to you latter.
