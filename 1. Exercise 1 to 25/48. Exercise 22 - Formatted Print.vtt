Hi everyone!

1
00:01.900 --> 00:04.700
This is a question off exercise 22.

2
00:04.750 --> 00:14.740
And for this exercise I want you to create a dictionary of keys a, b, c. So we have three keys and each

3
00:14.740 --> 00:25.610
key will have as a value a list from 1 to 10 for key a, 11 to 20 for key b, and 21 to 30 for key c.

4
00:25.720 --> 00:31.930
So a dictionary of three keys of three values and the values are these three lists and then please print

5
00:31.930 --> 00:34.580
out the dictionary.

6
00:35.080 --> 00:44.650
So the output of these would be this one in here. As you can see this is a pretty print.

7
00:44.710 --> 00:53.810
So a nice print of the dictionary. If you use print you probably get a not very nice view of the dictionary.

8
00:53.980 --> 00:57.950
So take care of that too please.

9
00:58.490 --> 00:59.320
And yeah, I'll talk to you later.

00:59.320 --> 00:59.620
Thanks.
