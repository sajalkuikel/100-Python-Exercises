Hi everyone!  This is the solution to exercise 12. For this exercise

1
00:04.910 --> 00:11.010
you were given this range object, so the selected line is what you were given and you were required

2
00:11.040 --> 00:18.730
to produce a list whose items are equal to the items of this range multiplied by 10.

3
00:18.750 --> 00:21.230
So the output would be this one in.

4
00:21.240 --> 00:24.450
Here. And this is how you solve it.

5
00:24.450 --> 00:28.640
So you would want to use a list comprehension here.

6
00:28.680 --> 00:30.740
This is the list comprehension.

7
00:30.870 --> 00:34.780
So this is like a for loop but inside square brackets.

8
00:34.800 --> 00:42.390
So in one single line and what we're doing is we're saying 10 times X where X is a variable we have

9
00:42.620 --> 00:44.270
we are just defining in here.

10
00:44.640 --> 00:47.580
Sue for x in my range.

11
00:47.640 --> 00:52.310
So what this will do is you go through all the items off my range.

12
00:52.320 --> 00:59.630
So it goes to the first item which is 1 and what it does it adds 10 times one in a new list.

13
00:59.670 --> 01:09.480
So you have all this starting with 10 and then loop goes to the next iteration so it does 10 times 2 and

14
01:09.480 --> 01:11.500
it puts 20 to the list.

15
01:11.530 --> 01:14.060
So that's all the items one by one.

16
01:14.070 --> 01:16.610
You could also do this using a for loop.

17
01:16.610 --> 01:21.080
So a standard for loop. That will also be fine but this is more pythonic.

18
01:21.090 --> 01:25.660
So we can't call this solution a better one because it's shorter.

19
01:25.900 --> 01:31.000
Then we use the print statement to print this list which is in here.

20
01:31.770 --> 01:32.900
That's about the solution.

21
01:32.940 --> 01:33.740
Thanks.

22
01:33.750 --> 01:34.370
See you later.
