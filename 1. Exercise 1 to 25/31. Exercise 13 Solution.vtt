Hi there! This is the solution to exercise 13. For this exercise you were asked to create a script that

1
00:06.870 --> 00:12.420
converts all items of these selected to range to strings.

2
00:12.690 --> 00:20.010
So the expected output would be this one down here in the terminal and you know I did this in one line.

3
00:20.820 --> 00:22.290
The key function

4
00:22.290 --> 00:24.890
here is the map function.

5
00:24.930 --> 00:27.780
So this is a built in Python function.

6
00:27.780 --> 00:34.550
What it does is it applies is a function to an iterable object.

7
00:34.770 --> 00:39.600
So my range is an object where you can't iterate. So this function

8
00:39.630 --> 00:46.920
it goes to all the items of my range and it applies the string function. As you know the string function

9
00:46.950 --> 00:50.370
is a function that converts numbers to strings.

10
00:50.400 --> 01:00.600
So if you do a str brackets and inside brackets you pass one you get a string of one like this one

11
01:00.600 --> 01:01.510
here.

12
01:01.580 --> 01:11.100
And yeah, then I converted this map object to a list and then I printed out the list which is this one in here.

13
01:11.390 --> 01:11.790
Thanks.

14
01:11.790 --> 01:14.510
If you have questions feel free to ask them.

15
01:14.510 --> 01:15.200
See you later.
