Hello in this video I'll show you the best practices on how to solve an exercise.

1
00:05.980 --> 00:14.290
So in other words I'll pretend I'm a student now and  I'll go ahead and solve the first exercise. So or here on

2
00:14.290 --> 00:16.860
the left I have the Udemy interface, and here on the right

3
00:16.870 --> 00:26.020
I have opened an empty folder which I named  pyexercises as you in here and I'll be working with Atom editor.

4
00:26.210 --> 00:29.200
So you can right click and go to open Atom.

5
00:32.740 --> 00:38.940
Once you have opened Atom, then you don't need this folder anymore.

6
00:38.950 --> 00:46.030
Actually get close that and you can work on Atom and I'll suggest you create one file for each exercise.

7
00:46.330 --> 00:53.320
So for exercise one, I'll go ahead and say one.py. That's the first file and you'll see that

8
00:53.680 --> 00:56.390
in the folder now, one file has been created.

9
00:56.410 --> 01:03.630
So a Python file and then I'll have 2.py, 3.py up to

10
01:03.760 --> 01:04.350
100.py.

11
01:04.960 --> 01:06.940
So let's look at the first exercise.

12
01:11.710 --> 01:11.990
OK.

13
01:12.010 --> 01:15.540
The first thing you need to look at is this bar in here.

14
01:15.550 --> 01:20.980
So we have four different levels. We have beginner, we have easy, intermediate, and experienced.

15
01:21.040 --> 01:26.110
So this is just to give you an idea of the difficulty level of the current exercise.

16
01:26.170 --> 01:30.300
This also the science on how many points an exercise has,

17
01:30.310 --> 01:32.140
but I'll go through that later.

18
01:32.140 --> 01:39.400
So you always have a question here for each exercise of this one it says let's start with easy things

19
01:39.400 --> 01:39.640
first.

20
01:39.640 --> 01:40.090
OK.

21
01:40.330 --> 01:42.450
What will the following code produce?

22
01:42.460 --> 01:45.210
Now as you can see this is quite an easy exercise.

23
01:46.680 --> 01:50.520
The first exercises are easy but that gets complex.

24
01:50.520 --> 01:53.310
So  you need to be patient.

25
01:53.350 --> 01:55.020
This one I prefer to do it mentally.

26
01:55.020 --> 02:04.230
I don't want to write that in a Python file, but normally most exercises ask you to write some programs.

27
02:04.260 --> 02:06.060
So this is a special exercise.

28
02:06.180 --> 02:12.080
This is asking you to say what output this gives and you can't just say  the answer mentally.

29
02:12.330 --> 02:17.220
So for this two four six this would be a six.

30
02:17.220 --> 02:24.850
So the output for this would be six. Six is my answer. If you need help, then you can follow these arrows.

31
02:24.870 --> 02:28.350
They will take you to a hint.

32
02:28.400 --> 02:34.110
Which says Python reads and executes scripts from top to bottom which means that a gets a value

33
02:34.110 --> 02:37.990
of two first then it gets a value of four and six then six

34
02:38.020 --> 02:43.230
is used here and print will print out that last updated value.

35
02:43.230 --> 02:49.330
However if you like you can try that code out in the Python terminal.

36
02:49.530 --> 02:58.640
That and then you'd open platformio ide terminal. Python 1 tap 6.

37
02:58.650 --> 03:00.000
So that's the answer.

38
03:00.000 --> 03:07.890
And then you can check your answer against the solution which is always in the next article.

39
03:07.930 --> 03:11.800
So this says one point and then you can check the answer.

40
03:12.070 --> 03:15.690
Here's the exercise for reference for your convenience.

41
03:15.850 --> 03:22.600
I have included here the code for the exercise and the answer is 6 and 6 was my answer so I can note down

42
03:22.600 --> 03:23.810
6 points.

43
03:23.830 --> 03:25.610
Sorry, 1 point for this one.

44
03:25.670 --> 03:31.690
And you can do that using a pen on a paper. I'd prefer a pen and paper, but if you like you can do

45
03:31.690 --> 03:41.710
that digitally so you can create a file here. Let's say points.txt. And you say so exercise 1, 1.

46
03:41.710 --> 03:42.820
One point.

47
03:43.420 --> 03:47.020
So exercise 2, 1 point, exercise 3, 2 points.

48
03:47.020 --> 03:47.450
And so on.

49
03:50.400 --> 03:57.150
Later you can use Python to make the sum of all your points when you have reached exercise 100.

50
03:57.610 --> 04:02.970
And you'd use that total number of points to see what category you fall in.

51
04:03.130 --> 04:05.080
So your skill level.

52
04:05.800 --> 04:07.940
Yeah, you're going to have an article on that

53
04:08.050 --> 04:16.580
at the end of the course. You also have the explanation here if you want to know more about this solution of the

54
04:16.580 --> 04:17.560
exercise.

55
04:17.560 --> 04:23.360
So sometimes you'll learn new things so you don't ignore them even if you if you feel that you understood

56
04:23.380 --> 04:29.700
well the exercise. Often there is something new that you may learn while reading or watching some videos.

57
04:29.770 --> 04:32.740
So don't ignore the explanation.

58
04:32.770 --> 04:35.730
Yeah, this is about exercise number one.

59
04:35.730 --> 04:39.440
And if you click continue you'd go to exercise 2, but I won't do that.

60
04:39.460 --> 04:42.310
So I hope this is clear.

61
04:42.520 --> 04:43.050
And, yeah.

62
04:43.210 --> 04:47.090
Now you can move on to the first exercise of the course.

63
04:47.260 --> 04:48.660
I'll talk to you later.
