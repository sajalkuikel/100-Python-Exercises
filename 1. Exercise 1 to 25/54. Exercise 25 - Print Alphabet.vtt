This is a question of exercise 25.

1
00:03.080 --> 00:10.980
And for this exercise I'd like to make a script that prints out letters of  the English alphabet from

2
00:11.040 --> 00:12.990
A to Z.

3
00:14.070 --> 00:23.490
And this is the expected output. So one letter in each line.

4
00:24.490 --> 00:25.890
I hope you crack this easily.

5
00:26.090 --> 00:26.480
Thanks.

6
00:26.480 --> 00:27.020
And see you later.
