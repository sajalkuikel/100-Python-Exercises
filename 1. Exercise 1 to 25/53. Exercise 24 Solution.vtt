Hi again, this is the solution to exercise 24.

1
00:06.090 --> 00:08.640
You were asked to complete this script.

2
00:09.150 --> 00:12.450
So this was the initial script. The dictionary only.

3
00:12.810 --> 00:18.320
So you get this expected output, these three lines in here.

4
00:18.450 --> 00:20.540
This is the solution.

5
00:20.890 --> 00:28.720
We're using a for loop and we're iterating through the items of the dictionary.

6
00:29.000 --> 00:31.420
I think you can try this.

7
00:31.430 --> 00:41.280
Print d.items to see well that gives you. So that gives you a dict item object

8
00:44.230 --> 00:46.670
So this is a special object.

9
00:46.670 --> 00:53.530
And then you have two of variables here, key and value and each of these variables will go through each

10
00:53.590 --> 00:55.610
of these tuples in here.

11
00:55.750 --> 01:02.620
So key will be replaced with this b in the first iteration and the value will be replaced with this

12
01:02.950 --> 01:04.130
list.

13
01:04.150 --> 01:09.280
So we're talking about the first iteration and in that first iteration what you do is you print out the

14
01:09.280 --> 01:10.090
key.

15
01:10.090 --> 01:15.100
So b. B is printed out in here.

16
01:15.100 --> 01:20.780
Then a comma and then you print out a string 'has value'.

17
01:21.430 --> 01:26.520
So 'has value' is printed there and then value which is the list in here.

18
01:27.280 --> 01:30.030
The same for the second iteration.

19
01:30.050 --> 01:34.020
And so on and this is the solution to this exercise.

20
01:34.030 --> 01:39.720
So the key here is dictionary.items.

21
01:39.790 --> 01:41.660
Thanks and I'll talk to you later.
