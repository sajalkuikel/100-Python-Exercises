Hi there! This is the solution to exercise 23 and for this exercise you were asked to access

1
00:07.190 --> 00:12.390
the third value key b and you were given these two lines.

2
00:12.480 --> 00:13.800
The output was 13.

3
00:13.800 --> 00:18.100
So the third line of this list is 13.

4
00:18.360 --> 00:20.170
And this is the solution.

5
00:20.220 --> 00:27.740
And it could also be good to print intermediate results such as a dictionary.

6
00:28.200 --> 00:31.100
Sue I can explain things better with this.

7
00:31.110 --> 00:35.370
It's a very good practice that you do as well to print out intermediate results.

8
00:35.530 --> 00:38.580
So I'm accessing key b first.

9
00:38.640 --> 00:46.620
Actually I'm accessing the value of key b which is this list so up to here this is a list object.

10
00:47.290 --> 00:58.560
This list in here. And then from this list I access the third item which has an Index of 2. So 0, 1,

11
00:58.680 --> 00:59.500
and 2.

12
00:59.780 --> 01:05.430
And that will give me integer 13 and that's what I'm getting in here. That's the solution.

13
01:05.430 --> 01:05.910
Thanks a lot.
