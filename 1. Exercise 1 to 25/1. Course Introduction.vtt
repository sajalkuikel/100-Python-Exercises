Hi and welcome to the Python video Workbook!

1
00:05.030 --> 00:11.420
This is a special course as it is entirely exercise based which means you are the one who is going to

2
00:11.420 --> 00:15.900
create the programs, the Python programs instead of me in the video

3
00:15.900 --> 00:23.850
as it generally happens with video courses. There are 100 exercises or assignments if you like

4
00:24.020 --> 00:29.180
and in each assignment you are given a Python problem to solve.

5
00:29.180 --> 00:35.420
That could be a way to fix an error or create a program from scratch or simply change a part of some

6
00:35.420 --> 00:39.490
existing code to get an expected output.

7
00:39.500 --> 00:45.170
The assignments are sometimes given as text and sometimes for more more complicated programs,

8
00:45.310 --> 00:52.700
there will be a video where I show you the behavior of the program that you are required to build. And then each

9
00:52.700 --> 01:00.340
exercise is immediately followed by the exercise solution so you can compare your solution to my solution.

10
01:00.350 --> 01:04.750
However keep in mind that sometimes solutions can be different of course.

11
01:05.060 --> 01:10.910
So if your output is the same as mine you can mark that exercise solved.

12
01:11.270 --> 01:13.650
So output is what matters.

13
01:13.730 --> 01:19.010
However if you are aren't sure about the efficiency of your solution you can post your solution in the

14
01:19.040 --> 01:23.660
Q&A area so I can give you some feedback.

15
01:23.660 --> 01:28.380
Moreover the exercises are scores depending on their difficulty level.

16
01:28.490 --> 01:33.780
So you are advised to keep track of the points you collect because at the end of the course you will

17
01:33.780 --> 01:40.960
be able to use your total points to see what category level your your Python skills fall in.

18
01:41.010 --> 01:45.120
Yep that would be an introduction about the course and the next video

19
01:45.140 --> 01:50.090
I'll show you with the tools you need to complete this course and the video after that

20
01:50.210 --> 01:56.690
I'll demonstrate best practices on how to solve an exercise so that you are sure you are making the best

21
01:56.840 --> 01:58.440
of the course.

22
01:58.550 --> 01:59.810
I'll talk to you later.

23
01:59.810 --> 02:00.110
Thanks.
