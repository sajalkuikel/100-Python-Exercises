Hi everyone and in this video I'll hand you exercise number 11

1
00:03.780 --> 00:10.080
because as I've mentioned before for some exercise where I think I need to show the

2
00:10.140 --> 00:15.620
output on a video, for such exercise will be having video as you see now.

3
00:16.080 --> 00:21.220
So I'm using the Atom editor with the platformio ide terminal here.

4
00:21.600 --> 00:24.050
Let me execute the exercise

5
00:24.150 --> 00:26.010
11.

6
00:26.100 --> 00:31.710
So what I'm executing now is a finished script so the solution for the exercise, but I won't show you

7
00:31.710 --> 00:36.350
the solution. I'll be exiting this and just show you the output.

8
00:36.350 --> 00:44.740
So for this exercise please generate at list from 1 to 20 but do not create the list manually.

9
00:44.840 --> 00:48.960
such as creating square brackets 1, 2, 3, and 4 and so on.

10
00:49.050 --> 00:53.390
So please generate a list dynamically and print it out as I did in here.

11
00:53.400 --> 00:53.700
Thanks.
