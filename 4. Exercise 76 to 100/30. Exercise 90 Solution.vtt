Hi, this is a solution to the exercise 90.

1
00:03.840 --> 00:11.470
And you were asked to produce say Susie fall out of a selection of records from your database file.

2
00:11.740 --> 00:17.570
And as you can imagine this is very similar to the previous exercise.

3
00:17.700 --> 00:24.990
With the only difference is that here you're not selecting countries only, so not the country column but

4
00:25.050 --> 00:26.040
all the columns.

5
00:26.040 --> 00:32.910
So we're using an asterisk to denote that we want all the columns from the countries table.

6
00:33.140 --> 00:34.330
Yeah that's the difference.

7
00:34.410 --> 00:41.430
And we're also importing pandas here because we need pandas to generate the text, the csv file.

8
00:41.490 --> 00:46.450
So the key here is to use the from records method.

9
00:46.650 --> 00:49.430
So pandas.DataFrame.

10
00:49.440 --> 00:53.220
So you're creating a data frame object from records.

11
00:53.730 --> 00:57.340
So these should be database records.

12
00:57.510 --> 01:13.250
Here we are passing the rows, so you know from the previous exercise that rows they look like this.

13
01:13.280 --> 01:19.110
So these are the rows, tuples with values for each column.

14
01:19.730 --> 01:20.460
OK.

15
01:23.790 --> 01:27.810
And yeah, we construct that frame from that.

16
01:27.810 --> 01:35.740
The problem is we don't have any columns for that data frame so we need to create such columns

17
01:35.740 --> 01:37.080
manually.

18
01:37.080 --> 01:38.370
This is what I'm adding here.

19
01:38.520 --> 01:42.390
Df.columns equals to this list of column names.

20
01:42.770 --> 01:52.040
And then finally once you have the data frame which I can print out in here,

21
01:57.150 --> 02:00.790
the data frame looks like this, nice and clean.

22
02:01.350 --> 02:08.870
And you can just go ahead and export that data frame to csv. Give the file name and index equals

23
02:08.880 --> 02:12.090
to false.

24
02:12.570 --> 02:19.080
Which means that you don't want to throw this column here, the first column to the csv file because

25
02:19.080 --> 02:23.390
you have this column so this should be enough rank there. You don't want this column as well.

26
02:23.470 --> 02:29.310
This is the csv file. That was the exercise.

27
02:29.310 --> 02:31.570
This is quite, a very useful exercise.

28
02:31.830 --> 02:35.130
You may encounter later in your career.

29
02:35.140 --> 02:39.750
So please take a note of this script and I'll talk to you later.

30
02:39.750 --> 02:40.040
Thanks!
