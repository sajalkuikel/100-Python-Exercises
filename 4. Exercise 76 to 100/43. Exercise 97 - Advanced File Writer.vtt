All right here you are with another challenging exercise.

1
00:04.730 --> 00:07.430
This is a question for exercise 97.

2
00:07.700 --> 00:13.310
I'd like you to create a program that asked the user to submit text repeatedly just as you did in the

3
00:13.310 --> 00:14.880
previous exercise.

4
00:15.190 --> 00:22.700
But in the previous exercise we were saving the changes and closing the program and the file with one

5
00:22.700 --> 00:23.540
single command.

6
00:23.540 --> 00:30.200
So with the Close command. In this exercise I'd like you to change your program so that the program

7
00:30.200 --> 00:37.000
saves the changes when you do submits save, but the program doesn't close, and also the program saves

8
00:37.020 --> 00:42.050
changes and closes as it did in the previous exercise when the user submits close.

9
00:42.080 --> 00:46.230
This is a behavioral program.

10
00:48.260 --> 00:52.460
Write a value, as you can see a file was created.

11
00:52.540 --> 00:57.490
Use the data, save close dot txt. You can give it any name you want.

12
00:57.500 --> 00:59.650
I'm going to split it on the right here.

13
00:59.690 --> 01:01.860
So a new file has been created.

14
01:01.970 --> 01:03.500
Now if you enter some values. Hey.

15
01:06.620 --> 01:14.870
The value is not written there immediately because the user has not entered save. Another hi.

16
01:15.020 --> 01:24.410
And then if you press, if you enter save the changes will be saved in there, but the program is still running.

17
01:24.410 --> 01:28.750
So if you want you can see that values there.

18
01:29.000 --> 01:36.560
And save. Hi again is there. Hi once more.

19
01:37.100 --> 01:43.960
Now if you press close, the program saves the last submitted line and closes.

20
01:43.970 --> 01:48.500
So as you can see if this gives the user more control to the program.

21
01:49.160 --> 01:54.900
I hope this is clear and I hope you solve this exercise, and yeah, I'll talk to you later.
