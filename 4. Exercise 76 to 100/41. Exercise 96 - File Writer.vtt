Hey this is a question for exercise 96 and for this exercise I'd like to create a program that asks

1
00:09.910 --> 00:16.820
the users to submit text repeatedly which means like this.

2
00:17.710 --> 00:29.620
So the user enters hey there you and so on and so forth. And the program closes when the user enters

3
00:29.680 --> 00:33.570
CLOSE with capital letters.

4
00:33.590 --> 00:37.380
At that point a text file has been created.

5
00:37.510 --> 00:45.270
This one here, data.txt where you have all the user submitted values one in each line.

6
00:45.400 --> 00:47.070
Hey there you.

7
00:47.920 --> 00:53.800
And of course close it's not there because close has to be interpreted as a command to close the file

8
00:54.310 --> 00:56.330
and to close the program.

9
00:57.160 --> 01:11.020
And of course if someone executes the script the program again Hi again CLOSE, hi again is inserted in

10
01:11.020 --> 01:13.490
the text file, in the existing text file.

11
01:13.870 --> 01:17.670
That's the functionality you need to have for this program.
