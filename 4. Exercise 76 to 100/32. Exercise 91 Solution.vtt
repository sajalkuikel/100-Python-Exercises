Hi again, this is the solution to exercise 91 where you were asked to insert these rows of this text file

1
00:09.330 --> 00:13.670
to the database.db file.

2
00:13.800 --> 00:15.590
This is how I did it.

3
00:15.760 --> 00:23.220
And so I used SQLite3 and Pandas. I used Pandas because I wanted to load the text file as

4
00:23.220 --> 00:24.710
a data frame in Python.

5
00:25.090 --> 00:29.360
And then I use SQLite3 to connect to the database establishing a connection

6
00:29.380 --> 00:30.890
creating a cursor object.

7
00:31.040 --> 00:34.590
And then I iterate through the data frame.

8
00:37.220 --> 00:48.120
Iterrows is a method that lets me access the index so it generates indexes and rows for each row.

9
00:48.540 --> 00:53.810
So then you can access the value for a column for that row.

10
00:54.360 --> 01:00.030
So I'm accessing the value of the country column for the first row and the value for the area column

11
01:00.030 --> 01:02.270
for that first row in the first iteration.

12
01:02.270 --> 01:04.170
And so one each value.

13
01:04.550 --> 01:08.500
And you don't need to print those values out as I'm doing here.

14
01:08.520 --> 01:14.570
So this is not obligatory to do ,but it's good, but it's good to have intermediate results.

15
01:14.720 --> 01:15.980
This is the important thing.

16
01:16.110 --> 01:19.620
You need to include inside the for loop.

17
01:19.920 --> 01:26.600
So you want to execute an SQL query for each iteration.

18
01:26.640 --> 01:37.500
So you want to insert into the country's tables a table of values NULL, so this is the auto increment ID.

19
01:37.500 --> 01:46.050
You don't need to insert any value there because SQLite3 will take care by itself by increasing the

20
01:46.050 --> 01:49.660
ID one by one and then

21
01:49.830 --> 01:53.390
these are like placeholders that will be replaced.

22
01:53.580 --> 02:01.870
This one will be replaced with the value for country and this one with the value for the area.

23
02:02.160 --> 02:03.760
And this will be NULL.

24
02:04.440 --> 02:06.960
So there will be no value for this

25
02:07.120 --> 02:12.750
column in here, the population.

26
02:14.410 --> 02:16.040
And we commit these changes.

27
02:16.060 --> 02:22.420
So we're using a commit method here after we end, we finish with the loop so the loop ends there and

28
02:22.420 --> 02:27.180
then we use commit to apply the changes and then we close the connection.

29
02:27.250 --> 02:31.160
That's how you insert values to a database.

30
02:31.340 --> 02:33.010
Yeah I hope this was clear.

31
02:33.070 --> 02:34.270
I'll talk to you later.

32
02:34.270 --> 02:34.850
Thanks a lot.
