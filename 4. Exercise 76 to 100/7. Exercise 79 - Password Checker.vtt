Hello this is the question for exercise 79 and for this exercise

1
00:06.970 --> 00:16.360
I'd like you to create a program that lets the user submit a  password through impute until the

2
00:16.360 --> 00:18.850
password satisfies three conditions.

3
00:18.850 --> 00:24.410
So the password contains at least one number, it contains an uppercase letter, at least one upper case

4
00:24.430 --> 00:29.280
letter, and the password is at least 5 characters long.

5
00:30.060 --> 00:38.080
So if one of these conditions is not satisfied, you want to print out this message 'password is not

6
00:38.170 --> 00:39.160
fine'.

7
00:39.340 --> 00:47.200
Let me demonstrate the programe. 79.

8
00:47.200 --> 00:52.160
So first I'll create a password that contains at least one number.

9
00:52.180 --> 00:59.590
So we're satisfying the first condition, however this is saying the passport is not fine because the other

10
00:59.590 --> 01:02.150
two conditions have not been satisfied.

11
01:02.560 --> 01:06.360
So this is asking again to enter a password.

12
01:06.430 --> 01:10.840
Let me satisfy the first two conditions this time.

13
01:11.170 --> 01:19.990
So at least one number and an uppercase letter, bout not five characters long yet, so password is not

14
01:19.990 --> 01:21.580
fine again.

15
01:21.580 --> 01:33.070
So this time I want to enter a number, a big letter, and also have the password at least five characters

16
01:33.070 --> 01:33.530
long.

17
01:33.580 --> 01:37.720
So all three conditions and this time I get 'password is fine'.

18
01:37.760 --> 01:41.560
And the script stops executing.

19
01:41.780 --> 01:45.630
This is what you want to build in this exercise.

20
01:46.070 --> 01:48.550
I wish you good luck with that and I'll talk to you later.
