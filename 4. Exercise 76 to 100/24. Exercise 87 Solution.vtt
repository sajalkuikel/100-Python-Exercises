Hey, this is a solution to exercise 87 and you were asked to add the missing items of this list to this

1
00:10.560 --> 00:11.580
file.

2
00:12.260 --> 00:17.610
And actually I wanted you to create a new file, but if you added the items to the existing file that is

3
00:17.700 --> 00:18.710
fine as well.

4
00:18.900 --> 00:19.740
So the new file

5
00:19.740 --> 00:21.330
I created was this on here.

6
00:21.570 --> 00:27.180
So from 201 countries I came up with 204 countries.

7
00:27.180 --> 00:32.870
So three more. This is the solution.

8
00:33.050 --> 00:39.510
What I did to this list first I added to each item I added this backslash character so that I had 

9
00:39.510 --> 00:44.820
them ready to insert to the text file.

10
00:44.820 --> 00:53.150
So now we have Portugal backslash n, Germany backslash n, and Spain backslash n, and then I open the countries

11
00:53.220 --> 01:03.580
missing file, existing file in read mode and I generated the list containing 201 countries as items

12
01:03.630 --> 01:06.360
in that list. And what I did then

13
01:06.390 --> 01:07.770
is a simple thing.

14
01:08.130 --> 01:15.610
I have these two lists, 201 items here and 3 items there and I simply added those two lists.

15
01:15.630 --> 01:21.880
So when you add up two lists you end up with a list containing the items of all the lists.

16
01:22.230 --> 01:31.960
And I also sorted out that list because at this point if you print out check list

17
01:32.400 --> 01:37.290
plus content.

18
01:40.620 --> 01:49.230
And if you go to the top of the list you'll see that Portugal, Germany, and Spain are added in the beginning

19
01:49.230 --> 01:49.660
of the list.

20
01:49.680 --> 01:50.580
But you don't want that.

21
01:50.580 --> 01:58.440
So that's why I applied a sorted function there which sorts the items in alphabetical order which is

22
01:58.440 --> 02:00.190
what we want.

23
02:00.230 --> 02:01.490
So from A to Z.

24
02:01.770 --> 02:10.140
And then the last thing I did was created a file where I inserted the new list, the updated list.

25
02:10.380 --> 02:16.380
So I simply iterated through that list and we have those brake lines already there.

26
02:16.380 --> 02:24.460
So I just wrote each item in there and I ended up with this list. That's the solution.

27
02:24.480 --> 02:26.940
I hope it was clear, and see you later.
