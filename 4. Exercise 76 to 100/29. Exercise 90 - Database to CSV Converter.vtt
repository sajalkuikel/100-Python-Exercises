Hi! This is the question for exercise 90.

1
00:04.840 --> 00:10.900
So imagine you had a web of the question and you have a database where you store the data for your web

2
00:10.900 --> 00:17.470
application and then you have users who visit your web site and maybe you have a service where the users

3
00:17.470 --> 00:21.400
want to create, to generate a csv file.

4
00:21.400 --> 00:29.110
So a csv file is like a text file with data and they want to generate a csv file with some data from your

5
00:29.110 --> 00:30.570
database.

6
00:30.880 --> 00:33.440
And this exercise around this topic.

7
00:33.550 --> 00:40.450
So please for this exercise, please download the database file, database.db or to use it

8
00:40.750 --> 00:45.210
if you have it already from the previous exercise. It's the same file.

9
00:45.250 --> 00:52.990
Please use Python to access the database table rows that have an area of greater than so an area of

10
00:53.200 --> 01:01.170
2 million square kilometers or greater than that, and then please export those rows to a csv file.

11
01:01.570 --> 01:08.790
And please export the rows together with area, and the csv file should look like this.

12
01:08.850 --> 01:16.730
Let me execute the script.

13
01:16.790 --> 01:18.560
This is the csv file.

14
01:18.650 --> 01:23.850
So it has a rank column, country, area, and population.

15
01:23.950 --> 01:32.270
These columns are in the database, but these are filters to include only the rows with an area of greater

16
01:32.270 --> 01:36.320
or equal to 2 million square kilometers.

17
01:36.320 --> 01:43.970
So this is quite useful if you build web applications because the user could have a simple interface

18
01:44.010 --> 01:50.870
where he could query some data and then on the back end you use Python to generate that csv file.

19
01:51.250 --> 01:54.500
So I hope you crack this, and I'll talk to you later.
