Hi this is the solution to exercise 94 and for this exercise I'll ask you to remove the s letters from

1
00:08.820 --> 00:10.010
this file.

2
00:10.020 --> 00:16.510
So in https and also add a slash in here and this is how I did it.

3
00:16.560 --> 00:25.710
So first I opened the text file in read mode and I created a list containing all these lines as items

4
00:27.660 --> 00:35.460
and I'm just printing the list here for intermediate results and then I created a new file where I wanted

5
00:35.460 --> 00:41.870
to drop, to throw, to put the new cleaned lines in there.

6
00:42.480 --> 00:53.550
So in write mode and than while the file is open I iterate through this list. Let me execute the script

7
00:53.550 --> 00:58.470
to see what's going on.

8
00:58.470 --> 01:02.190
So this lines list look looks like this.

9
01:04.830 --> 01:08.820
And now the key here is to start from the small bits.

10
01:08.820 --> 01:15.410
So first you want to remove the s letters from those lines.

11
01:15.410 --> 01:24.450
And so I created this variable inside the loop so that will be equal to line.replace s with

12
01:24.570 --> 01:25.300
nothing.

13
01:25.320 --> 01:31.440
So I'm replacing the S letters with an empty string which means I'm removing the S letters.

14
01:31.450 --> 01:32.380
This one here,

15
01:32.390 --> 01:43.050
this one specifies that I want to remove, to replace the first occurrence of S letters because you know if

16
01:43.050 --> 01:51.480
you don't put S there, if you don't put 1 there Python will remove for this line.

17
01:51.480 --> 01:55.240
For example it will remove this S but this one also.

18
01:55.330 --> 02:02.030
So you'll end up with www.tackoverflow.com. You don't want that.

19
02:02.070 --> 02:04.310
So that's why you need one there.

20
02:04.680 --> 02:15.030
So at this point we have, in the first iteration we have a http google.com and then what we do to google

21
02:15.050 --> 02:18.110
dot com we add a slash.

22
02:18.180 --> 02:29.720
So how I'm doing that is you know I split the line. Let me print this one here line_remove_s,

23
02:32.360 --> 02:40.130
print line_remove_s_add_slash execute.

24
02:41.250 --> 02:43.410
So this is what's going on here.

25
02:49.180 --> 03:02.060
So this is line_remove_s and from this I'm accessing the first six letters which is one, two, three, four,

26
03:02.150 --> 03:05.280
five, and six.

27
03:05.800 --> 03:11.480
After that I add a new slash which is this one in here.

28
03:11.480 --> 03:19.680
Then I concatenate that with this part of the string so starting from position 6 up to the end.

29
03:19.930 --> 03:27.760
So I'm concatenating these three strings in here and yeah that's the idea. I do that for all of the iterations,

30
03:28.150 --> 03:31.530
for all the lines of the text file.

31
03:31.540 --> 03:39.670
And of course I write this line remove_s_add_slash variable which is a concatenation of these three

32
03:39.700 --> 03:40.630
strings.

33
03:40.630 --> 03:46.680
Added to the file with write method. That is the idea.

34
03:46.680 --> 03:52.200
So quite tricky and I hope you understand it now. Thanks, I'll talk to you later.
