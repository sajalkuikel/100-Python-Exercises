Hi, and let me hand you the last exercise for the course. So this is a question for exercise 100.

1
00:08.010 --> 00:16.620
For this exercise please create a web app with Flask that lets users submit a username and password

2
00:17.490 --> 00:21.560
through the web page of the of the web app and so

3
00:21.690 --> 00:31.510
This app checks each user name exist and if the password satisfies three conditions as in exercise 81,

4
00:32.400 --> 00:41.770
so you're going to have to use this code, exactly this code to implement it to a web app.

5
00:42.780 --> 00:53.800
As you remember this solution was checking for a user name if it existed like Pluto exists.

6
00:54.030 --> 00:55.290
But this doesn't exist.

7
00:55.320 --> 00:59.970
And this password would be fine.

8
00:59.970 --> 01:03.210
So users.txt has some existing usernames

9
01:05.940 --> 01:06.500
and so,

10
01:10.180 --> 01:16.080
here is now how this web app should look like.

11
01:17.060 --> 01:22.420
So it's running on the browser, go to the browser.

12
01:22.830 --> 01:24.170
Localhost 5000.

13
01:24.170 --> 01:27.030
This is the web app.

14
01:27.310 --> 01:35.220
Again the web apps should check the users.txt file for usernames.

15
01:35.220 --> 01:45.880
Let's say I'm entering Pluto again and password 8U which is a good password, but this is saying username

16
01:45.910 --> 01:52.340
exists so you have to enter username again, a username and a new password again.

17
01:52.360 --> 02:01.150
So if I enter a username that doesn't exist in the file let's say me, and let me put a password.

18
02:01.660 --> 02:03.520
But this is not valid.

19
02:04.270 --> 02:11.570
If I say submit this will tell me to check my password.

20
02:11.920 --> 02:21.430
So for the last time if I enter a valid username and a valid passport with numbers and big letters, and I

21
02:21.430 --> 02:32.970
press submit, this will say success and then of course you you may want to render these text boxes again so that

22
02:32.970 --> 02:36.480
the users if they want to enter, to submit data again

23
02:36.490 --> 02:37.650
they can do it.

24
02:38.000 --> 02:44.150
Yeah this is the web application how it looks like.

25
02:45.390 --> 02:46.860
I hope you solve this.

26
02:47.010 --> 02:56.480
Thanks a lot for taking this course and I hope you solved as many exercise as possible.

27
02:56.520 --> 02:57.270
And yeah, thanks a lot!
