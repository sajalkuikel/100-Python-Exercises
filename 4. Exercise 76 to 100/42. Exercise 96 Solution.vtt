All right, this is a solution to exercise 96. What I'm doing is I'm opening a file in apend mode which means

1
00:10.440 --> 00:14.210
if the file doesn't exist, afile with this name will be created.

2
00:14.250 --> 00:21.540
Otherwise the content will be appended to the existing file. That ensures that when you execute the program

3
00:21.540 --> 00:30.060
for a second time the lines of the user submits they will be added, appended to the existing text file.

4
00:30.220 --> 00:39.900
So we need a loop then to ask the user repeatedly for input. Here we ask for input and immediately we

5
00:39.900 --> 00:45.350
need to check if that input is equal to a closed string.

6
00:45.630 --> 00:52.090
If it is equal we close the file which means we are saving the changes to the file.

7
00:52.350 --> 00:58.740
And so you can view the file with other programs, the content of the file. And you also break

8
00:58.740 --> 00:59.080
the loop

9
00:59.100 --> 01:06.070
if that input is equal to close and that stops the program.

10
01:06.340 --> 01:12.950
Otherwise if that is not equal to close, so it can be equal to anything in that case we write that

11
01:12.960 --> 01:15.310
content in the file.

12
01:15.510 --> 01:20.430
That's the program, quite straight forward, and I'll talk to you later.
