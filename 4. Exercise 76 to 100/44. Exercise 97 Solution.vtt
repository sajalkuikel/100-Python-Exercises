Great, this is the solution to exercise 97.

1
00:05.900 --> 00:10.940
So I'm opening the file in append mode.

2
00:10.940 --> 00:16.330
Then of course I need a while loop to have the program running all the time.

3
00:16.430 --> 00:26.280
I ask the user for input and if that line is equal to save, I close the file, and then I open the file again.

4
00:27.410 --> 00:33.070
So I'm closing the file because if you don't close the file the changes will not be written there, so the file

5
00:33.090 --> 00:41.210
is still open in Python and you can not see the file content with other programs because you haven't

6
00:41.300 --> 00:45.530
saved those changes yet, so close save changes and closes the file.

7
00:45.800 --> 00:53.240
However the program is still learning so what you want to do is you want to open the file again because

8
00:53.240 --> 01:00.170
that's what the user wanted, so they wanted to save the changes, but not close the program.

9
01:00.170 --> 01:05.720
However your solution may be different, but if you're getting the same output as mine then you

10
01:05.720 --> 01:07.370
should be good to go.

11
01:07.700 --> 01:12.750
And then we're using elif here because we have multiple conditions.

12
01:12.760 --> 01:18.180
If line is equal to close, then we close the file and we break the while loop,

13
01:18.420 --> 01:20.650
so we close the program.

14
01:20.710 --> 01:24.090
Otherwise if the string is not saved and is not closed,

15
01:24.090 --> 01:27.740
then we write that string to the file.

16
01:28.220 --> 01:33.440
That's more or less about the solution for this exercise.

17
01:33.470 --> 01:37.070
This is clear and I'll talk to you later.
