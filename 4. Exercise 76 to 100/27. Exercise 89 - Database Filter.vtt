This is the question for exercise 89.

1
00:03.310 --> 00:07.980
And here we're going to interact with databases.

2
00:08.160 --> 00:17.550
So please download the database file called database.db and this file contains a table with 50 countries

3
00:19.110 --> 00:25.730
along with the area for each country in square kilometers and the country population.

4
00:25.740 --> 00:29.270
Let me quickly show you how the table looks like.

5
00:29.850 --> 00:37.200
I'm using this small program called Browser for SQLite, or SQLite Browser. You don't need

6
00:37.200 --> 00:44.520
this program. I just want to show you how the table looks like. So you can open a database and in the

7
00:44.520 --> 00:49.020
file I'm giving you that you have in resources is this on here.

8
00:49.050 --> 00:51.230
If you're open that you go to browse data.

9
00:51.230 --> 00:53.110
This is how the data looks like.

10
00:53.550 --> 01:01.710
So we have an ID, country area, and population and you have 50 countries in there.

11
01:02.540 --> 01:04.490
Ok. And now what I want you to do,

12
01:04.560 --> 01:12.240
I want you to use your iPhone to print out those countries that have an area of greater than 2 million

13
01:12.240 --> 01:13.370
square kilometers.

14
01:13.560 --> 01:20.260
So the output would be this one in here.

15
01:21.390 --> 01:28.860
So just that. These are the countries that have an area of greater than 2 million square kilometers

16
01:29.280 --> 01:32.430
and you have to print them out. Thisis it.

17
01:32.430 --> 01:32.960
Thanks.

18
01:32.960 --> 01:33.700
See you later.
