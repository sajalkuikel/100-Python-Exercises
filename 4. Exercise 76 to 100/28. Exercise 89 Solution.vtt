Hi again, this is the solution to exercise 89.

1
00:05.070 --> 00:10.190
And you were asked to access rows from a database file.

2
00:10.440 --> 00:14.020
So I used sqlite3 for this exercise.

3
00:14.250 --> 00:21.450
You need to install it with pip install sqlite3, and then it's quite straightforward.

4
00:21.460 --> 00:30.460
As you see few lines of code you need to create a connection object using connect method of sqlite3.

5
00:30.630 --> 00:33.060
So you just pass the path to the database.

6
00:33.060 --> 00:38.110
This happens to be in the same directory with my 89.py file.

7
00:38.130 --> 00:47.420
So I just pass the file name there cur, and then we need to create a cursor object by referring to our connection

8
00:47.420 --> 00:48.590
object.

9
00:48.770 --> 00:51.950
Then you apply the execute method to the cursor object.

10
00:51.950 --> 00:57.860
So you want to execute a query, an sql query to your database.

11
00:57.910 --> 01:04.090
So the query is select country. Contry is the name of the column.

12
01:04.310 --> 01:11.170
So we want to print out country names and select country from countries. Country is the name of the

13
01:11.180 --> 01:20.370
table in the database where area is greater or equal than 2 million square kilometers.

14
01:22.720 --> 01:29.540
So we want countries where area is greater than that, and you need to use the fetch all method then to your

15
01:29.540 --> 01:37.280
cursor object so that will create an object with tuples containing the data, the names of all the countries.

16
01:37.560 --> 01:40.990
And then you need to close the connection to the database.

17
01:41.440 --> 01:44.050
So that's about interacting with the database.

18
01:44.070 --> 01:45.790
Now it's all Python.

19
01:45.790 --> 01:54.490
So you have these rows and you just need to iterate through that and because you know these rows...

20
01:55.630 --> 01:56.170
Let me print out rows.

21
02:01.940 --> 02:03.290
Python 89.

22
02:08.070 --> 02:15.260
Ok, this is the rows object, so it's a list of tuples and each tuple contains a country.

23
02:15.420 --> 02:19.300
Therefore that's why I'm doing here for i,

24
02:19.390 --> 02:21.380
so i will be each tuple.

25
02:21.400 --> 02:29.650
So i,  and I'm printing the first item of i which is Russia for the first tuple, and I then Canada, and so on.

26
02:29.650 --> 02:35.140
So I'm able to extract the strings and print them out in here.

27
02:35.360 --> 02:37.910
That's the solution for this exercise.

28
02:38.110 --> 02:41.390
If you have questions, please ask them in the Q&A area.

29
02:41.640 --> 02:46.270
I hope you're enjoying the course and we have still some more exercises to go.

30
02:46.270 --> 02:48.000
Thanks and I'll talk to you later.
