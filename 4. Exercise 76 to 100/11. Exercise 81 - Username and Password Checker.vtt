Hi, this is the question for exercise

1
00:03.150 --> 00:10.710
81 and up to here this is the same as the previous exercise so you create a script that prompts

2
00:10.770 --> 00:17.330
the user for a passwords and then it checks for these three conditions.

3
00:17.370 --> 00:23.520
And if the user didn't enter a password that satisfies these, one of these conditions at least

4
00:23.820 --> 00:32.050
one of, or all of them, and then you give the exact reason why the user hasn't created a correct password so you give

5
00:32.750 --> 00:37.190
what condition has not been satisfied.

6
00:37.230 --> 00:45.050
However for this exercise I'd like you to implement some user name capabilities as well.

7
00:45.330 --> 00:51.910
Please download this users.txt text file.

8
00:52.560 --> 00:54.620
Let's say these are user names.

9
00:54.690 --> 00:55.380
OK.

10
00:55.690 --> 01:01.410
I know I know these are planets but let's say these are user names in a database.

11
01:02.040 --> 01:10.320
So we have some existing user names and say you want to create a program where users create their new

12
01:10.320 --> 01:15.780
username and password, so you have new users, but you have some existing users so you don't want

13
01:16.050 --> 01:23.920
your new users to choose a user name that is the same as this ones in here, as your current users.

14
01:23.950 --> 01:33.870
So before asking for a password, please ask the users for a username. This is how the program should

15
01:33.870 --> 01:38.160
work. Enter username.

16
01:38.370 --> 01:43.290
Let's say I entered Pluto. It says user name exists.

17
01:43.440 --> 01:49.980
So I enter a user username again. Ardit, yeah the user name is fine.

18
01:50.340 --> 01:55.980
If the user name is fine, then you want to go to the next thing which is enter password so the program

19
01:55.980 --> 01:58.900
is asking me to enter the password.

20
01:58.930 --> 02:04.050
This now works the same as the previous exercise.

21
02:04.050 --> 02:07.760
So when you don't satisfy one of these conditions you get these messages.

22
02:07.920 --> 02:16.220
So let me satisfy all the conditions like that and it says password is fine.

23
02:16.460 --> 02:18.590
This is, this new program

24
02:18.600 --> 02:26.100
is quite complex, but if you have the previous script that means you have completed half of this

25
02:26.100 --> 02:27.900
program.

26
02:28.310 --> 02:29.370
Hope you solve it.

27
02:29.370 --> 02:30.120
I'll talk to you later.
