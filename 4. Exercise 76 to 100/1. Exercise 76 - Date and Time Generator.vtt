Hello again, this is the question for exercise 76 and for for this exercise

1
00:06.540 --> 00:14.660
I just want you to print out this string, this text in here.

2
00:14.710 --> 00:24.450
However, please note that this is actually the current day, the current month, the current date, the current year.

3
00:24.660 --> 00:29.340
So you have to generate these dynamically. Don't just write down

4
00:29.340 --> 00:33.130
today is Wednesday December 28 2016.

5
00:33.430 --> 00:35.520
Yeah, that's the question for this exercise.

6
00:35.550 --> 00:36.510
I hope you solve it!

7
00:36.600 --> 00:37.600
I'll talk to you later.
