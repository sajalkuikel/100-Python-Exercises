Hi, this is a question for exercise 95 and for this exercise I'd like to ask you to create a program

1
00:10.330 --> 00:20.110
that asks the user to enter some values, enter some values separated by commas.

2
00:20.650 --> 00:28.990
Let's say the user enters Mars, Jupiter, Earth, and Earth.

3
00:29.550 --> 00:36.010
And once they use presses enter the program will store those values in a text file.

4
00:36.010 --> 00:39.430
So if there is no text file a new text file will be generated.

5
00:39.430 --> 00:42.140
So it was, this was just generated.

6
00:42.420 --> 00:45.800
And so you see these three values in there.

7
00:45.920 --> 00:53.610
Also you want to have the program to add new values to that text file.

8
00:53.740 --> 00:55.920
When someone executes the program again.

9
00:56.080 --> 01:03.060
So let's say I'm adding Pluto in there. Enter and you see Pluto is added there.

10
01:03.490 --> 01:08.140
Yeah that's the functionality I'd like to have for this program.

11
01:08.200 --> 01:10.430
I hope you solve it and I'll talk to you later.
