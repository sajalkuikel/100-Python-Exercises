Hello, this is the question for exercise 87, and for this exercise

1
00:05.880 --> 00:15.570
I'd like to give you this list with three items and now these items are missing in this file and you

2
00:15.570 --> 00:16.910
can find this file

3
00:17.080 --> 00:25.410
attached in this article, so Portugal, Germany, and Spain are not among these countries.

4
00:25.470 --> 00:34.520
And what I'd like you to do is I want you to add these three items into this list.

5
00:34.800 --> 00:36.160
So to create,

6
00:36.280 --> 00:41.400
I want you to create a new file containing all of these countries.

7
00:41.430 --> 00:48.560
So there are 201 countries there and I want you to a file contains, containing

8
00:48.560 --> 00:55.650
201 plus Portugal, Germany, and Spain. That's for this exercise.

9
00:55.800 --> 00:56.470
Good luck.

10
00:56.470 --> 00:57.160
So you later!
