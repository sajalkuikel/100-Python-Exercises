Hi, this is a question for exercise 78. You know if you were planning to write a Web app with Python

1
00:09.870 --> 00:15.750
and you'll have users logging into your system and you want to generate a password for all these users,

2
00:15.780 --> 00:19.710
so you want to generate random passwords with Python,

3
00:20.030 --> 00:21.130
how would you do it?

4
00:21.340 --> 00:28.680
So the question for this exercise is to create a program that generates a password of six random alphanumeric

5
00:28.680 --> 00:38.160
characters in this range in here. So letters of the alphabet and numbers, and big letters, and

6
00:38.160 --> 00:41.680
also these characters.

7
00:42.060 --> 00:44.000
So let me demonstrate the program.

8
00:46.630 --> 00:47.410
You execute it.

9
00:47.420 --> 00:54.390
It creates a string password of six characters, you execute it again. Every time you execute it

10
00:54.470 --> 00:57.540
you get a different password there, a random one.

11
00:58.040 --> 01:00.990
So please do that if you can and I'll talk to you later.
