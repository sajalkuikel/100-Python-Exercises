Hello! Here's the solution to exercise 85.

1
00:03.890 --> 00:12.530
And here you were asked to create a script that prints the countries_raw.txt file.

2
00:12.630 --> 00:20.100
This is supposed to contain a list of countries, but it also has lines such as A, a brake line here.

3
00:20.100 --> 00:24.200
Top of Page and so on and so forth.

4
00:24.210 --> 00:31.560
And you want to clean, to remove those lines so that you ended up with this clean file of countries only.

5
00:31.580 --> 00:34.820
This is how you do it.

6
00:35.250 --> 00:43.170
And let me explain the code so I'm reading the countries_raw.txt file and creating a list

7
00:43.920 --> 00:45.410
out of that file.

8
00:45.420 --> 00:53.630
So a list content. Let me print that out as soon as I create the list here to show you how the list

9
00:53.660 --> 00:59.470
looks like. 85.

10
00:59.580 --> 01:02.890
So this is the list.

11
01:03.480 --> 01:12.400
Here is A, the first line, and then the brake line. And then Afghanistan, Albania, and so on Algeria, and so forth.

12
01:12.400 --> 01:20.610
And each of these countries they also have this \n' which is a brake line, a special character

13
01:21.030 --> 01:23.550
and you want to remove that as well.

14
01:23.550 --> 01:30.810
So what I'm doing here is I'm using these comprehensions to iterate through the items of the list and

15
01:30.810 --> 01:33.440
apply things like strip

16
01:33.540 --> 01:41.610
in this case, so for the first list comprehension, I'm removing the \n'  characters from all

17
01:41.610 --> 01:43.090
the lines.

18
01:43.250 --> 01:48.690
So all of them have such a character so it's wise to remove that first.

19
01:48.690 --> 01:51.100
So remove those characters for i.

20
01:51.160 --> 02:00.450
For i in content if, this is that. It's good to have the comprehension generic.

21
02:00.480 --> 02:10.600
So if there is an item without this character we're sure not to get an error to interrupt our script so that

22
02:11.980 --> 02:18.620
shall remove the backslash from our list. I can print it out again.

23
02:18.720 --> 02:23.620
And you see now that's there are no \n' characters there.

24
02:23.770 --> 02:24.270
OK.

25
02:24.380 --> 02:30.360
And the next thing I'd do was I used the list comprehension again so I'm building a list.

26
02:30.530 --> 02:37.630
I'm saying that's put i in the list for i in content.

27
02:37.880 --> 02:46.040
If i is not an empty string. For instance you have this empty string here.

28
02:46.490 --> 02:50.390
So what I'm doing is I'm saying put i in a list

29
02:50.420 --> 02:52.040
if i is not an empty string.

30
02:52.340 --> 02:54.870
Otherwise don't put that in the list.

31
02:54.920 --> 03:01.190
So I'm updating the contents list and putting all the items that are not empty strings in there.

32
03:04.070 --> 03:04.660
And after that

33
03:04.660 --> 03:08.920
what I do is I remove the strings

34
03:09.020 --> 03:15.120
Top of Page using the same comprehension as as this one here.

35
03:15.140 --> 03:18.820
So it's exactly the same.

36
03:18.940 --> 03:28.510
And you can check the intermediate results at this point if you like and you'll see that there are no

37
03:29.200 --> 03:38.890
empty strings now, but you still have these letters, so  O P and the countries as well.

38
03:38.890 --> 03:43.430
So you want to remove the letters now and leave the countries. So how do you do that?

39
03:43.430 --> 03:44.240
Well, the letters

40
03:44.240 --> 03:47.320
what specific attribute do they have?

41
03:47.500 --> 03:49.920
Well they have a length of one.

42
03:50.710 --> 03:52.300
That's what I thought about.

43
03:52.600 --> 03:58.670
If your imagination is better than mine you could find some other attributes.

44
03:58.750 --> 04:00.650
So this is what I did.

45
04:01.420 --> 04:07.470
Leave i there if the length of i is not equal to 1.

46
04:07.940 --> 04:09.970
And so that will remove

47
04:13.450 --> 04:21.550
all the single letters from the list.

48
04:22.070 --> 04:30.850
Then what I did was I created a new file, and then I iterated through the clean list, and then I wrote

49
04:31.420 --> 04:41.830
those lines in the list plus a brake line so that they are separated each in a separate line.

50
04:41.890 --> 04:43.730
This was the script.

51
04:44.500 --> 04:47.370
I hope it was clear and I'll talk to you later.
