Hi! We have one more exercise with database.

1
00:04.290 --> 00:10.800
So this is the question to exercise 91 and for this exercise please download the database file database.db

2
00:10.830 --> 00:17.060
again or if you have either I did just use what you have and also please download ten_more_countries

3
00:17.060 --> 00:21.090
.txt file which looks like this.

4
00:21.120 --> 00:26.420
So we have 10 countries and the area along each country.

5
00:26.580 --> 00:30.210
So Id, country name, and area.

6
00:31.100 --> 00:37.960
And what I want you to do is I want you to add the rows of this file.

7
00:37.970 --> 00:45.090
These 10 rows to the database file so that the database looks like this.

8
00:45.090 --> 00:54.360
So we have 50 countries from the existing database but then we have 10 more countries added from the

9
00:54.360 --> 00:56.650
text file starting from Spain.

10
00:56.880 --> 00:57.550
Turkmenistan.

11
00:57.570 --> 01:01.350
And so on up to Japan.

12
01:01.580 --> 01:07.870
And you also see that the text file didn't have a population column and therefore these would be NULL

13
01:07.870 --> 01:08.440
in here.

14
01:08.870 --> 01:10.660
We have nothing to add there.

15
01:11.030 --> 01:15.890
So that's the outputs points you need to generate.

16
01:16.590 --> 01:19.550
Hope you find this fun and I'll talk to you later.
