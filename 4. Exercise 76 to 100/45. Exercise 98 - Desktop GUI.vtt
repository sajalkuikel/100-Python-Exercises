Hi again! This is very hard to solve. Anyway,

1
00:05.270 --> 00:08.160
this is the question for exercise 98.

2
00:08.370 --> 00:17.750
You have to create a program that asks the user to submit text through a graphical user interface.

3
00:17.830 --> 00:26.200
Let me show you how this interface looks like, and all the details of how the program works.

4
00:26.300 --> 00:34.120
This is a graphical user interface and it has three buttons an Add line, Safe changes, and a Save and close

5
00:34.140 --> 00:35.210
button.

6
00:35.490 --> 00:42.900
And it also has an entry text box where the user will enter the text.

7
00:42.900 --> 00:52.260
Let's say first line in here. If the user wants to add the line to the text file it presses add line

8
00:52.740 --> 00:54.850
and the text box empties.

9
00:54.850 --> 01:00.420
So it's clears off and the user can enter more text lines in there.

10
01:00.420 --> 01:06.570
However at this point to you as a programmer you haven't created, you haven't added the lines to a text

11
01:06.570 --> 01:08.340
file yet.

12
01:08.340 --> 01:19.080
If you want to do that you want to press save changes and then you see you have to create this, not that.

13
01:19.130 --> 01:19.440
This

14
01:19.530 --> 01:22.400
user_gui file.

15
01:22.410 --> 01:25.680
So this is the first line.

16
01:25.680 --> 01:27.500
Now if the user wants

17
01:28.410 --> 01:35.520
to enter more lines, second line, I have a typo there.

18
01:36.900 --> 01:41.790
Third line maybe, add line, save changes, and the lines are added instantly

19
01:41.880 --> 01:44.760
in the text file when the user presses save changes.

20
01:44.760 --> 01:53.970
And lastly if the user wants to close the program and just say save and close, and the program stops,

21
01:54.040 --> 02:01.740
and the text file is there, and you can of course execute the program again.

22
02:01.740 --> 02:05.960
Fourth line, add line, save and close.

23
02:06.180 --> 02:13.550
Fourth line is added there. So yeah, it's a bit complex but try to build it as much as you can.

24
02:14.600 --> 02:17.450
Hope you enjoy this and I'll talk to you later.
