All right here is the question for exercise 84. For this exercise please use the pyglet library to create

1
00:08.250 --> 00:11.940
a hello world application that looks like

2
00:18.000 --> 00:20.140
this.

3
00:20.910 --> 00:29.340
So it's just a window, a graphical user interface pyglet is a library, a third party library for games, to build

4
00:29.340 --> 00:31.020
games in Python.

5
00:32.170 --> 00:37.170
And yeah, this does require some research to come up with this and I wish you good luck!

6
00:37.200 --> 00:37.960
See you later.
