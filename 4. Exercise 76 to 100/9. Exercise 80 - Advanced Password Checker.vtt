Hi, again, this is the question for exercise 80.

1
00:04.830 --> 00:07.680
Yet another interesting exercise, but quite challenging.

2
00:07.920 --> 00:15.050
And in this exercise I'd like you to create a script again as the previous exercise that lets the users submit

3
00:15.150 --> 00:22.440
a passwords until they have satisfied these three conditions, so passwords contains at least one number, one

4
00:22.500 --> 00:26.450
uppercase letter, and it is at least five characters long.

5
00:27.010 --> 00:33.860
But in deference to the previous exercise for this exercise I don't want a generic message.

6
00:34.020 --> 00:37.460
That says one of you know, the password is not fine.

7
00:37.500 --> 00:41.100
You don't know which of the conditions is not satisfied.

8
00:41.190 --> 00:48.570
You know this isn't very useful for the user because they may keep trying a password but you never say

9
00:48.570 --> 00:54.780
the real reason whether they have less than five characters or they are missing and uppercase letter

10
00:54.780 --> 00:55.700
and so on.

11
00:55.710 --> 01:02.310
So please give exact reason of why the user has not created a correct password this time.

12
01:02.310 --> 01:04.840
So let me demonstrate this.

13
01:04.990 --> 01:07.680
Exercise 80, enter password.

14
01:12.710 --> 01:18.930
So if I enter ya this is saying please check the following.

15
01:19.460 --> 01:25.040
You need at least one number, you need at least one uppercase letter, you need at least five characters.

16
01:25.370 --> 01:31.120
So let me enter an uppercase letter and this time it says again please check the following.

17
01:31.520 --> 01:36.950
You need at least one number, you need at least five characters, so the message you need at least one upper

18
01:36.950 --> 01:38.970
upper case letter has gone.

19
01:38.970 --> 01:40.500
It's not here anymore.

20
01:40.890 --> 01:49.290
So the same if you do five characters you get you need at least one number.

21
01:49.580 --> 01:54.530
If you put a number there, then it says password is fine.

22
01:54.530 --> 01:57.820
This is what you have to build in this exercise.

23
01:57.850 --> 02:01.110
I know it's quite challenging and tricky but give it a try.

24
02:01.580 --> 02:03.130
I hope you solve it.

25
02:03.180 --> 02:03.460
See you later.
