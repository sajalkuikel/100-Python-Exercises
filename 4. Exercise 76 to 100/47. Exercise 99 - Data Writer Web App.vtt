Hello.

1
00:02.630 --> 00:06.710
This is the question for exercise 99. For this exercise

2
00:06.710 --> 00:12.150
please create a program that asks the user to submit text through a web app.

3
00:12.170 --> 00:15.120
Anyway I did go a bit too far here.

4
00:15.190 --> 00:20.460
So this is quite difficult to do if you are not familiar with building web applications,

5
00:20.480 --> 00:27.950
but anyway you can see the solution in the next video where I explain to you the code and maybe you'll

6
00:27.950 --> 00:31.450
understand how the web applications are built.

7
00:32.240 --> 00:35.330
And we're building this with a Fask web framework.

8
00:35.570 --> 00:48.660
So a Python library. Let me demonstrate you the web application. I simply run the script.

9
00:48.750 --> 00:54.140
That means the application is running and I can access it in this address.

10
00:54.210 --> 01:01.650
So port five thousand you can write down that address or you can do localhost5000. It's the

11
01:01.650 --> 01:02.410
same thing.

12
01:02.600 --> 01:03.900
And this is the web application.

13
01:06.980 --> 01:19.620
What this will do is let me submit some text there. Line 1 for instance, submit. That creates a text

14
01:19.620 --> 01:24.120
file, a text file yes, locally.

15
01:24.180 --> 01:28.200
So in this folder where the Python script is.

16
01:32.700 --> 01:40.360
And then the next time when you add more lines there, line 2, line 2 is added in that existing text file

17
01:41.300 --> 01:42.430
and so on.

18
01:42.550 --> 01:45.220
That's the web application.

19
01:45.220 --> 01:51.120
So I hope you solve this, but if you cannot then just the go and learn Flask in the next video.

20
01:51.780 --> 01:52.790
Talk to you there.
