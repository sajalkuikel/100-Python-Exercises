This is the solution to exercise 42 and for this exercise

1
00:04.920 --> 00:13.530
you were asked to print out in each line of the terminal the sum of homologous items from the two sequences.

2
00:14.080 --> 00:21.860
So you 5, 7 and 9. You were given these two sequences, so a list and a tuple.

3
00:22.020 --> 00:23.480
This is the solution.

4
00:24.210 --> 00:30.790
Every time we wanted to do, to print something in a separate line you'd want to use a for loop.

5
00:31.010 --> 00:34.370
And in this case we're using a zip function.

6
00:34.380 --> 00:42.120
It's a Python built in function and what it does, the zip function it returns an iterator object

7
00:42.330 --> 00:45.490
that aggregates two sequences.

8
00:45.600 --> 00:51.900
In this case a and b, the list and the tuple. And then with with two variables

9
00:51.900 --> 01:01.150
what you do is you access, in the first iteration you'd access the first item of each of these sequences.

10
01:01.310 --> 01:09.410
So one on four in the first iteration and then you return the sum of them which is five and so on and

11
01:09.410 --> 01:13.830
so forth until the last iteration which returns 9.

12
01:13.970 --> 01:20.900
So three plus six. That's for this solution and explanation. Use a zip function whenever you want

13
01:20.900 --> 01:24.520
to iterate to more than one sequence.

14
01:24.530 --> 01:24.880
Thanks.

15
01:24.890 --> 01:25.410
See you later.
