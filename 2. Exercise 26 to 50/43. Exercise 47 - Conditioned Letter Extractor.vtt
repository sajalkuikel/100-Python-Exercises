Hey there! This is the question of exercise

1
00:04.240 --> 00:05.580
47.

2
00:05.860 --> 00:12.670
And for this exercise I'd like you to write a script that iterates through each of the 26 text

3
00:12.670 --> 00:14.290
files.

4
00:15.100 --> 00:20.230
So these are the text files that we use in the previous exercises but you can also find them

5
00:20.340 --> 00:20.800
attached

6
00:20.860 --> 00:23.370
in this article for your convenience.

7
00:24.030 --> 00:33.060
And so then the script checks if the letter inside the text file is in string python and then puts

8
00:33.060 --> 00:39.110
the letter in a list if the letters is, if the letter is a character of that string.

9
00:39.390 --> 00:41.720
So then you print out the list.

10
00:41.770 --> 00:44.820
So this is the list.

11
00:44.950 --> 00:49.800
So again what we are doing is we're going through these text files.

12
00:49.850 --> 00:51.640
We're reading the content.

13
00:51.670 --> 00:58.630
So we go to the first file, A we read the content and we check if the contents of the file so if A

14
00:58.630 --> 01:08.090
is part of this string and if it is we put a in a new list. If it's not we go to the next file and so on.

15
01:08.300 --> 01:16.040
And we were consumed, we have consumed all the 26 files and then we print out the list that we

16
01:16.110 --> 01:19.330
constructed. That's the exercise.

17
01:19.330 --> 01:21.270
I hope you solve it and I'll talk to you later.
