Hi everyone! This is the solution to exercise 31 where you are asked to show why there is an error

1
00:07.530 --> 00:09.770
in the code and how to fix it.

2
00:10.300 --> 00:15.660
And so this is the code. We have a function which is quite clear and it doesn't have any errors but

3
00:15.690 --> 00:21.140
we're getting an error in line 6 which is this line in here.

4
00:21.230 --> 00:28.710
Error is a type error. That's the type of the error.. A type error means that you using the wrong object type to

5
00:28.710 --> 00:30.090
to do something.

6
00:30.180 --> 00:34.370
Something here is you have to look after the colon for more detail.

7
00:34.950 --> 00:39.630
So it says unsupported operand type for minus.

8
00:39.690 --> 00:46.290
So this operator doesn't support an operation between some types and then you need to see for more explanation

9
00:46.290 --> 00:47.700
after the colon.

10
00:47.700 --> 00:53.500
These are the types that a minus subtraction operator cannot support.

11
00:53.520 --> 00:59.290
So you cannot subtract a function type with an integer type. An integer is a number.

12
00:59.670 --> 01:08.970
And what a function is you know, this foo that I'm using here you can check it. Print type foo. So foo here,

13
01:09.090 --> 01:11.120
foo there and see what we get.

14
01:11.130 --> 01:16.110
If you execute this you'll see that this is a function type.

15
01:16.110 --> 01:20.760
But if you replace that with the function call,

16
01:24.460 --> 01:27.360
you'll see that that's that's an integer.

17
01:27.360 --> 01:30.630
So the function call is an integer, but the function itself,

18
01:30.630 --> 01:33.780
so the function blueprint is a function object.

19
01:33.780 --> 01:35.640
So the integer here would be like

20
01:35.750 --> 01:38.130
one plus two equals to three.

21
01:38.140 --> 01:40.370
So this is equal to 3.

22
01:40.380 --> 01:42.820
That's why the type is an integer.

23
01:42.870 --> 01:52.070
Therefore the solution here is you need to call the function. Execute and you don't get any error.

24
01:52.230 --> 01:54.370
You may want to print out X now.

25
01:54.930 --> 01:56.200
So feel free to do that.

26
01:56.520 --> 01:58.280
But this is the solution.

27
01:58.290 --> 02:00.220
So thanks and talk to you later.
