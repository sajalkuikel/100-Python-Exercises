Hi, this is the solution to exercise 30. For this exercise you are asked to find the reason why you're

1
00:08.070 --> 00:09.130
getting an error

2
00:09.330 --> 00:10.910
and how would you fix it.

3
00:11.130 --> 00:18.720
And this is output. So you get a syntax error meaning that you're not following the rules to write

4
00:18.720 --> 00:25.850
Python code and then you have the explanation in which they use non-default argument follows default

5
00:26.130 --> 00:34.610
argument which means that this non-default argument follows this default argument.

6
00:35.760 --> 00:36.730
So how do you fix it?

7
00:36.750 --> 00:47.370
Well, you just need to put the default argument after the non default argument. If you execute the

8
00:48.120 --> 00:51.090
script now you don't get any error.

9
00:52.120 --> 00:57.590
And you can also try out the functions to try to call the function.

10
00:57.990 --> 01:05.950
Let's pass 2 and also explain to you why you need to pass a non-default argument first.

11
01:06.120 --> 01:07.950
So I executed.

12
01:07.950 --> 01:09.240
Now I get four.

13
01:09.250 --> 01:11.400
Two plus two is four.

14
01:11.850 --> 01:15.020
Or let's pass three.

15
01:15.480 --> 01:17.470
So you get five.

16
01:17.760 --> 01:21.830
So why do you need to pass a non-default argument first?

17
01:21.870 --> 01:28.570
The reason is that sometimes you don't want to pass a value for the second argument.

18
01:28.770 --> 01:38.970
But if you want you can pass one like 3 and let's say 4 for this. So in this case a will

19
01:38.970 --> 01:40.330
be equal to 4.

20
01:40.410 --> 01:42.360
So three plus four is seven.

21
01:42.660 --> 01:47.110
But if you have this default argument in here,

22
01:47.370 --> 01:52.460
so you had it like that and then you just pass three for instance,

23
01:52.570 --> 01:53.710
Python will get confused.

24
01:53.740 --> 01:55.190
cause it doesn't know

25
01:55.230 --> 02:01.260
if you're passing 3 for b or for a and that's why you need to pass values for the non-default arguments

26
02:01.260 --> 02:03.200
first so that they get a value,

27
02:03.270 --> 02:11.910
all of them then if you want to pass more values then those values will be put to replace the default

28
02:11.970 --> 02:15.970
argument, the default argument values.

29
02:15.990 --> 02:17.420
I hope this is clear and thanks.

30
02:17.430 --> 02:17.930
See you later.
