Hi there! This the solution to exercise 39.

1
00:03.840 --> 00:12.500
And in this exercise you were asked to fix this script so that it prints of cosine of angle one

2
00:12.510 --> 00:18.110
radiant. Unfortunately the script is not printing that out.

3
00:18.190 --> 00:26.280
Instead it says there is an attribute error and then the explanation is saying that the module math has no

4
00:26.280 --> 00:27.790
no attribute cosine.

5
00:28.050 --> 00:36.720
And unfortunately Python isn't that smart as to say that cosine hey it's not the attribute you want to use to calculate

6
00:36.720 --> 00:38.080
the cosine.

7
00:38.160 --> 00:40.320
You need to use this attribute.

8
00:40.350 --> 00:46.810
So you need to figure out by yourself or ask you what you need to use to calculate the cosine

9
00:46.830 --> 00:50.580
of one radiant. And to do that

10
00:50.660 --> 00:51.450
I wold

11
00:51.630 --> 01:03.120
Want to open a Python session, interactive Python session. Import math and then I'll quickly look what methods

12
01:04.350 --> 01:06.120
the math module has.

13
01:06.540 --> 01:11.440
So you can have a quick look in here. Acos, acosh, asin.

14
01:12.120 --> 01:13.110
Maybe this one.

15
01:13.320 --> 01:15.740
So maybe I want to use that method.

16
01:15.810 --> 01:18.660
But you can ask for help.

17
01:18.660 --> 01:21.660
Math.cos.

18
01:23.580 --> 01:24.610
I can see that

19
01:24.690 --> 01:30.590
it says this returns the cosine of X measured in radiants.

20
01:30.600 --> 01:34.930
So you pass radiant there. Cos like that.

21
01:34.950 --> 01:38.340
Save the script, exit Python.

22
01:41.670 --> 01:47.420
39 and yeah, this time you get the correct value.

23
01:48.530 --> 01:51.370
So that's how you'd fix this script.

24
01:51.620 --> 01:57.320
But if you of do it like that, then you do want to do some google search to see how to find the cosine

25
01:57.320 --> 02:03.130
of a number in Python. That's the solution.

26
02:03.200 --> 02:05.180
The explanation for this exercise.

27
02:05.240 --> 02:06.490
Thanks a lot.

28
02:06.530 --> 02:07.040
See you later.
