This is the question of exercise 46.

1
00:03.700 --> 00:11.340
For this exercise you are required to write a script that extracts letters from the

2
00:11.340 --> 00:19.570
twenty six text files that we created in the previous exercise and then put those letters in a python

3
00:19.570 --> 00:20.160
list.

4
00:20.310 --> 00:23.520
And of course print out the list.

5
00:24.380 --> 00:31.250
If you don't have the 26 text files you can find them attached in this article.

6
00:31.260 --> 00:35.300
So this is expected output of the script.

7
00:35.520 --> 00:39.400
So I hope this is clear, but ask questions if you don't understand anything.

8
00:39.750 --> 00:40.800
I'll talk to you later.
