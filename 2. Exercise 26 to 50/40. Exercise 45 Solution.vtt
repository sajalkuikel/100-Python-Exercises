It's me again and

1
00:03.060 --> 00:10.030
this is a solution to exercise 45. You are asked to create a script that generates not less, but 26

2
00:10.040 --> 00:18.420
text files and each text file will contain one letter of the English alphabet as the text file name,

3
00:18.750 --> 00:22.490
but also the letters should be inside the text file.

4
00:24.780 --> 00:28.060
This is my solution.

5
00:28.460 --> 00:36.770
I made it a bit advanced so I decided to create a solution that creates a folder named letters

6
00:36.910 --> 00:37.920
and inside that folder

7
00:37.920 --> 00:42.830
it puts all of these 26 text files.

8
00:42.840 --> 00:51.510
So from A to Z and each letter has the letter inside them. Each file has the letter inside them.

9
00:51.600 --> 00:54.900
If you made this exercise differently,

10
00:55.140 --> 00:58.530
so you didn't create a folder, that's fine too.

11
00:58.530 --> 01:03.610
Anyway I'm going to explain here how the script works.

12
01:03.630 --> 01:09.410
So this is two lines that creates a folder named letters.

13
01:09.460 --> 01:14.220
And here I am importing the string the OS modules.

14
01:14.400 --> 01:15.630
You don't need to install them.

15
01:15.630 --> 01:17.900
They are standard libraries.

16
01:18.180 --> 01:22.520
And so I'm saying if this path exists.

17
01:22.710 --> 01:32.550
So if the letters directory exists, sorry if this path does not exist, so if not exists then create that

18
01:32.610 --> 01:34.040
directory.

19
01:34.110 --> 01:35.250
Otherwise don't do anything.

20
01:35.250 --> 01:38.400
So if there is such a folder, that don't do anything.

21
01:38.400 --> 01:40.360
Just go to the next line.

22
01:41.310 --> 01:47.880
So the next time I execute this nothing will be created because there's a folder with that name in there.

23
01:47.900 --> 01:58.760
And so we have a for loop in here as always. For letter in  string of all 26 letters.

24
01:58.810 --> 02:02.410
I'm opening a file with this path.

25
02:02.640 --> 02:08.350
So letters which is the folder name and then the slash and then letter.

26
02:08.730 --> 02:16.680
So a for for instance in the first iteration plus an extension which is .txt and we are opening that

27
02:16.710 --> 02:20.320
in write mode as a file variable.

28
02:20.370 --> 02:24.570
And then we rise that's later inside the file.

29
02:24.570 --> 02:27.590
An then we're also creating a break line there.

30
02:28.230 --> 02:31.710
But that's not necessary the case anyway.

31
02:32.540 --> 02:35.720
Again here is the file name.

32
02:35.810 --> 02:39.260
This is the content of the text file and I hope this is clear.

33
02:39.540 --> 02:40.690
I'll talk to you later.
