Hi everyone! This the solution to exercise 29. For this exercise

1
00:05.120 --> 00:12.890
you are asked to write a function that calculates liquid volume taken from these site in here.

2
00:13.020 --> 00:19.770
So this was the formula and you were also asked to consider that r is always 10.

3
00:20.250 --> 00:24.760
So let's say all of our spheres have a radius of 10.

4
00:24.780 --> 00:31.640
So you have to take that into consideration when building your code so that you make it very efficient.

5
00:32.190 --> 00:35.710
And if you pass 2 then you'd expect this output.

6
00:35.730 --> 00:38.820
OK, this is the solution I came up with.

7
00:39.060 --> 00:46.550
I'm importing pi which is a constant. It's somewhere at 3.14.

8
00:46.590 --> 00:51.370
You could also find that on the Internet and just type down the number in here.

9
00:51.770 --> 00:56.160
But you don't have to do it if you know how to import pi from here.

10
00:56.160 --> 00:59.000
And then we have the function down here.

11
00:59.340 --> 01:01.500
I'm passing two arguments here.

12
01:01.500 --> 01:05.690
A known non-default argument and a default argument.

13
01:06.120 --> 01:11.090
So the default argument means when you assign a value to that arguments,

14
01:11.160 --> 01:19.500
so when you call the function in here, you only pass one value that's will be replaced with the non-default

15
01:19.520 --> 01:20.660
arguments.

16
01:20.910 --> 01:26.090
And if you don't pass a value for the default argument 10 will be used.

17
01:26.100 --> 01:33.660
But if you want you can pass a value for the default argument as well like 5 and then 5 will be used for

18
01:33.720 --> 01:34.620
r everywhere.

19
01:34.620 --> 01:37.090
So 5 in power of 3.

20
01:37.090 --> 01:40.680
And so on. And yeah, that's about the arguments.

21
01:40.680 --> 01:42.310
And here is the formula.

22
01:45.600 --> 01:47.510
I think this is self explanatory.

23
01:47.510 --> 01:49.990
This is a multiplication multiplication.

24
01:49.990 --> 01:51.470
This is a power.

25
01:51.820 --> 01:54.350
So exponents and then, yeah

26
01:54.520 --> 01:56.140
we have the same things here, division.

27
01:56.170 --> 02:02.960
And so on. And then we return V, and then we print the function output.

28
02:03.070 --> 02:11.790
So 2 for age and then V will be printed out. That's the output of the function. I hope this is clear.

29
02:11.800 --> 02:13.060
And I'll talk to you later.

30
02:13.060 --> 02:13.480
Thanks.
