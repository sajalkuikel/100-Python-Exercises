Hi again! This is the solution to exercise 46 where you are asked to create a script that extracts

1
00:08.610 --> 00:16.910
letters from the 26 text files which I have in here in this folder called letters A to Z.

2
00:17.520 --> 00:29.510
And so you are asked to put those letters in a list, so the letters contained inside each of the text files.

3
00:29.550 --> 00:33.820
This is the solution. I'm using the glob library here.

4
00:34.080 --> 00:35.700
That's a standard library.

5
00:35.700 --> 00:36.990
You don't need to install it.

6
00:37.020 --> 00:42.840
Then I create a letters list here which is empty for now.

7
00:43.210 --> 00:45.290
Then I generate a list with glob.glob.

8
00:45.330 --> 00:50.240
And the globe method

9
00:50.400 --> 00:56.990
will be looking at this pattern, path pattern for file names.

10
00:57.450 --> 01:01.370
So it goes to the letters folder and then it gets everything.

11
01:01.530 --> 01:07.280
Ends with .txt so it gets the 26 text files.

12
01:07.640 --> 01:17.700
These ones in here and then iterate through that list because you know if you print file list

13
01:21.310 --> 01:27.050
you'll see that you get all the paths of your files and you iterate through this at list.

14
01:27.060 --> 01:37.420
So for let's say letters slash a.txt, you open it write mode as a file and then

15
01:37.450 --> 01:47.240
and you say letters, so letters is the list you have created earlier append file.read.

16
01:47.280 --> 01:54.020
So with file.read you're going to get the contents of that current file which is letter a

17
01:55.310 --> 02:02.940
and the backslash n character which is a break line and so you'd want to strip out that character

18
02:02.940 --> 02:04.960
from the content.

19
02:04.980 --> 02:14.640
So you end up with only a. And so you append the first letter to the letters list and then the loop goes back

20
02:14.700 --> 02:15.230
again.

21
02:15.360 --> 02:22.730
It goes to the next file name and does exactly the same thing until it goes to the very last file name.

22
02:23.270 --> 02:30.600
The loop stops and Python goes to the next line which is printing out the list letters which was

23
02:30.600 --> 02:34.030
constructed in the loop.

24
02:34.110 --> 02:36.500
That's quite nice and straightforward.

25
02:37.000 --> 02:40.430
I hope it's clear for you and thanks! I'll see you later.
